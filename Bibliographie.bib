	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Polymer Society of Korea and Springer Sciene+Business Media Dordrecht. Herein, we report the synthesis of a high performance electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI) composite by utilizing polyethersulfone (PES) as a model matrix. Thin films of PES filled with conductive multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were fabricated by a simple solution casting technique. The effect of filler concentration on EMI shielding efficiency, dielectric constant, electrical conductivity, hardness and thermal stability were investigated, and these properties were found to improve with the filler amount. An exceptionally high EMI shielding effectiveness of 35 dB (well above the common commercial EMI shielding requirement of 20 dB) was obtained in the X-band at a low thickness of 0.5 mm. Furthermore, the PES based CNT composites displayed a high electrical conductivity of 450 S/m. A high dielectric constant of 127 was obtained for a 20 wt{\%} CNT filled polymer composite which was 40 times larger than the pure polymer matrix. Characterization tools indicate the intimate contact between the host matrix (PES) and CNT filler, which provided synergistic effects for improving dielectric properties as well as EMI shielding.

For a reusable medical device, material reliability is an important parameter to decide its lifetime, as it will be subjected to the continuous steam sterilization process. A spring nature, clip component was selected out of a newly designed medical device (patented) to perform this reliability study. This clip component was sterilized for a predetermined number of cycles (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20@汥瑀瑯步渠 @汥瑀瑯步渠@汥瑀瑯步渠100) at 121 C for 30 min. A significant decrease of {\~{}}20{\%} in the compression force of the spring was observed after 30 cycles, and a {\~{}}6{\%} decrease in the lateral dimension of the clip was observed after 50 cycles. No further significant change in the compression force or dimension was observed for the subsequent sterilization cycles. Vickers hardness and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques were used to characterize the effects of sterilization. DSC results exhibited no significant change in the degree of cure and melting behavior of PEEK before and after the sterilization. Hardness measurement exhibited an increase of {\~{}}49{\%} in hardness after just 20 cycles. When an unsterilized sample was heated for repetitive cycles without the presence of moisture (121 C, 10 and 20 cycles), only {\~{}}7{\%} of the maximum change in hardness was observed.},

The specimens were fatigue-tested at various percentages of their static lap shear strengths at a load ratio R = 0.1 and frequency f = 5 Hz. The fatigue performances of resistance-welded semi-crystalline (PEKK) and amorphous (PEI) composites were compared and the failure modes of the specimens were described. The stiffness degradation was monitored during the tests in order to evaluate the damage accumulation in the specimens. Linear stress-life (S-N) curves were obtained for all three materials when plotted on a semi-log scale. Interlaminar failure modes, involving tearing of the heating element and damage to the adherends were observed. The indefinite fatigue lives of CF/PEKK and CF/PEI welded specimens were obtained at 25{\%} of their static lap shear strengths. The indefinite fatigue life of the GF/PEI welded specimens was obtained at 20{\%} of the static lap shear strength. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The interfacial characteristics directly influence the efficiency of nanotube reinforcements in improving mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the polymer nanocomposite. In this review, various techniques of interaction measurements, including experimental and modelling studies, are described. From the experimental approaches, wetting, spectroscopy and probe microscopy techniques are discussed in detail. Molecular dynamics, coarse grain simulation and density functional theory are also explained as the main modelling approaches in interaction measurement studies. Different methods of interaction improvement, mainly categorized under covalent and noncovalent interactions, are described afterwards. Modelling predictions of nanocomposite properties, such as Young's modulus, are compared with the experimental results in the literature and the challenges are discussed. Finally, it is concluded that an optimum carbon nanotube-polymer interaction is a key factor towards reaching the full potential of carbon nanotubes in nanocomposites. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes represent a relatively recently discovered allotrope of carbon that exhibits unique properties. While commercial interest in the material is leading to the development of mass production and handling facilities, little is known of the risk associated with exposure. In a two-part study, preliminary investigations have been carried out into the potential exposure routes and toxicity of single-walled carbon nanotube material (SWCNT)--a specific form of the allotrope. The material is characterized by bundles of fibrous carbon molecules that may be a few nanometers in diameter, but micrometers in length. The two production processes investigated use-transition metal catalysts, leading to the inclusion of nanometer-scale metallic particles within unrefined SWCNT material. A laboratory-based study was undertaken to evaluate the physical nature of the aerosol formed from SWCNT during mechanical agitation. This was complemented by a field study in which airborne and dermal exposure to SWCNT was investigated while handling unrefined material. Although laboratory studies indicated that with sufficient agitation, unrefined SWCNT material can release fine particles into the air, concentrations generated while handling material in the field were very low. Estimates of the airborne concentration of nanotube material generated during handling suggest that concentrations were lower than 53 microg/m(3) in all cases. Glove deposits of SWCNT during handling were estimated at between 0.2 mg and 6 mg per hand.},

	abstract = {The release assessment of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was performed on two types of polymer-CNT nanocomposites: polypropylene (PP) and polyamide 6 (PA6) containing 3 wt{\%} CNT. Nanocomposite films were prepared and then exposed to ethanol as a fatty-food simulant at 40 °C, and the amount of CNT release into ethanol was determined by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The CNTs released into ethanol were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and verified by Raman spectroscopy. UV-Vis analysis showed a very small amount of CNT release from the nanocomposite films into ethanol over 60 d: maximum CNT concentrations in ethanol were 1.3 mg/L for the PP-CNT film and 1.2 mg/L for the PA6-CNT film. GFAAS results indicated that the amount of CNTs released into ethanol after 12 d was over 20-fold higher than the results obtained by UV-Vis. Overestimation of CNT release by GFAAS suggested aggregation and poor dispersion of CNTs in the solvent. This assumption was verified by TEM images exhibiting the embedded CNTs in the polymer flakes, which could be poorly dispersed in the solvent. In general, CNT release from the nanocomposite films was considered a surface phenomenon, as indicated by detachment of CNT-containing polymer flakes from the film surface.},

Their morphology, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties were investigated and compared with the behavior of similar non-compatibilized composites. Scanning electron micrographs demonstrated better SWCNT dispersion for samples with polysulfone. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated a remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of PEEK/glass fiber by the incorporation of SWCNTs wrapped in the compatibilizer, ascribed to a significant thermal conductivity enhancement. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decrease in the crystallization temperature and crystallinity of the polymer with the addition of both wrapped and non-wrapped SWCNTs. The laminates exhibit anisotropic electrical behavior; their conductivity out-of-plane is lower than that in-plane. Dynamic mechanical studies revealed an increase in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature in the presence of polysulfone. Mechanical tests demonstrated significant enhancements in stiffness, strength and toughness by the incorporation of wrapped nanofillers, whilst the mechanical properties of non-compatibilized composites only improved marginally. Samples with laser-grown SWCNTs exhibit enhanced overall performance. This investigation confirms that SWCNT-reinforced PEEK/glass fiber compatibilized composites possess excellent potential to be used as multifunctional engineering materials in industrial applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The extent of the heat-affected zone was assessed by welding specimens without consolidation at different stages of the process. It was confirmed through optical microscopy that heat is generated at the interface and transferred to the bulk adherends earlier in the process for thinner ED. The analysis of their fracture surface under optimum welding conditions revealed signs of matrix degradation, leading to less consistent quality, likely due to faster heat generation rate in both the ED and the substrates, and incidentally, higher temperatures surrounding the energy director.},

	abstract = {An optical rectenna-a device that directly converts free-propagating electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies to direct current-was first proposed over 40 years ago, yet this concept has not been demonstrated experimentally due to fabrication challenges at the nanoscale. Realizing an optical rectenna requires that an antenna be coupled to a diode that operates on the order of 1 PHz (switching speed on the order of 1 fs). Diodes operating at these frequencies are feasible if their capacitance is on the order of a few attofarads, but they remain extremely difficult to fabricate and to reliably couple to a nanoscale antenna. Here we demonstrate an optical rectenna by engineering metal-insulator-metal tunnel diodes, with a junction capacitance of ∼2 aF, at the tip of vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (∼10 nm in diameter), which act as the antenna. Upon irradiation with visible and infrared light, we measure a d.c. open-circuit voltage and a short-circuit current that appear to be due to a rectification process (we account for a very small but quantifiable contribution from thermal effects). In contrast to recent reports of photodetection based on hot electron decay in a plasmonic nanoscale antenna, a coherent optical antenna field appears to be rectified directly in our devices, consistent with rectenna theory. Finally, power rectification is observed under simulated solar illumination, and there is no detectable change in diode performance after numerous current-voltage scans between 5 and 77 °C, indicating a potential for robust operation.},

Sampling, size, area, density, color, crystallinity, as well as purity compared to properties of non-MWCNT carbon and catalyst metals, are presented. No single measurement tool provides a complete characterization; therefore, we summarize methods that include scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fast Fourier transform of high-resolution TEM, Raman spectroscopy, reflectance and thermogravimetric analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals information with regard to functional groups interacting the tube surface. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis is reviewed as the basis for evaluating specific surface area. We extend the review by presenting taxonomy of defects present in MWCNTs. Finally, we provide an appendix from documentary standards that are pertinent and reasonable for bulk measurements. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

One method of incorporating intrinsic ESC mitigation while maintaining low color, flexibility, and optical clarity is through the utilization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). However, SWNTs are difficult to uniformly disperse in the polymer matrix. The approach reported herein employed amide acid polymers endcapped with alkoxysilane groups that could condense with oxygen containing functionalities that were present on the ends of SWNTs as a result of the oxidative purification treatment. These SWNTs were combined with the endcapped amide acid polymers in solution and subsequently cast as unoriented thin films. Two examples possessed electrical conductivity (measured as surface resistance and surface resistivity) sufficient for ESC mitigation at loading levels of ≤0.08wt{\%} SWNT as well as good retention of thermo-optical properties. The percolation threshold was determined to lie between 0.03 and 0.04wt{\%} SWNT loading. Electrical conductivity of the film remained unaffected even after harsh mechanical manipulation.},

A more homogeneous temperature distribution was generated by the metal mesh at the bonding surface. Glass fibre fabric reinforced PEI (GF/PEI) was used as an electrical insulator between the heating element and adherend laminates. Experimental results show that the GF/PEI prepreg could effectively prevent current leakage and enlarge the welding area. Welding parameters, such as input power level, welding time and pressure, were optimized according to the results of mechanical and microstructure characterization. Mechanical performance of composite specimens joined using metal mesh, in terms of lap shear strength and Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness, was equivalent to that of compression moulded benchmarks. Fracture surfaces of welded specimens showed mostly cohesive failure or intralaminar failure, indicating that good bonding between the PEI matrix and metal mesh was achieved.},

Colloidal systems consisting of CNTs with varying degrees of dispersion are prepared and characterized to evaluate CNT dispersibility and suspension stability in solvents with different polarities. The results show that an absolute value of zeta potential at about 25. mV is closely related to the micro- and macroscopic dispersion of CNTs, whereas a high absolute value of 40. mV is regarded as an indication of high quality CNT dispersion with much enhanced suspension stability in solvents. The absolute zeta potential value increases consistently with increasing degree of CNT functionality, the increase being most pronounced in a hydrophilic liquid such as water. A linear correlation is established between the surface energy of a CNT film and the oxygen to carbon ratio of CNT surface. The CNT dispersibility in a liquid is determined not only by their physical states, but also by the hydrophilicity and surface functionality of CNTs, all of which are reflected by zeta potential. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Two different resins were used to manufacture the CFRPs: neat epoxy resin, and epoxy resin modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The specimens of composite (the cathode of the galvanic cell) and metal (the anode of the galvanic cell) were paired and immersed in electrolyte (NaCl solution, 2 {\%} by weight) at 40 C, to simulate a corrosive environment and accelerate the electrochemical reaction. Results of corrosion rate (CR) and mass loss rate (MR) were obtained, and the electrical resistances of the CFRPs were also measured. This new study shows that the MWCNTs do not have a statistically significant impact on the corrosion and mass loss rate results, and that both types of CFRP composites have statistically the same electrical resistance. Therefore, common methods used in the engineering practice in conventional hybrid CFRP/steel joints and repairs may be sufficient to delay galvanic corrosion, as there is no increased liability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Fusion bonding and the use of thermoplastic films as hot melt adhesives offer an alternative to mechanical fastening and thermosetting adhesive bonding.

The improvement of thermoplastic polymer matrices, with the introduction of recent chemistries such as PEEK, PEI and PEKEKK. exhibiting increased mechanical performance, service temperature and solvent resistance (for the semi-crystalline systems) also supported the growth of interest for fusion bonding.

Physical mechanisms involved in the fusion bonding process for modelling purposes are discussed including heat transfer, consolidation and crystallinity aspects.

The high absolute value of PSF viscosity was explained with existing empirical correlations as a combination of low critical molecular weight and strong intermolecular interactions. The temperature dependence of viscosity was found to be close to that for polystyrene in the temperature range, Tg + 90 to Tg + 190°C. The die swell, end corrections, and melt fracture characteristics were also determined.

Characterization by SEM and TEM shows that surface functionalization of the nanowires resulted in significant dispersion of CuNWs in the PS matrix. The electrical characterization of the nanocomposites indicates that functionalized CuNWs start to form electrically conductive networks at lower concentrations (0.25 vol{\%} Cu) than using unfunctionalized CuNWs (0.5 vol{\%} Cu). The organic coating on the nanowires prevents significant changes in the electrical resistivity in the vicinity of the percolation threshold. Percolated nanocomposites showed electrical resistivity in the range of 10(6)-10(7) $\Omega$ cm. The transition from liquid-like to solid-like behavior (rheological percolation) of the nanocomposites was studied using dynamic rheology at 200 °C. Unfunctionalized CuNWs result in electrical and rheological percolation at similar concentrations. Functionalized CuNWs show rheological percolation at higher concentration (1.0-2.0 vol{\%}) than that required for electrical percolation. This is attributed to the decrease in the interfacial tension between nanowires and polymer chains and its effect on the viscoelastic behavior of the combined polymer-nanowire networks.},

From unique electronic properties and a thermal conductivity higher than diamond to mechanical properties where the stiffness, strength and resilience exceeds any current material, carbon nanotubes offer tremendous opportunities for the development of fundamentally new material systems. In particular, the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, combined with their low density, offer scope for the development of nanotube-reinforced composite materials. The potential for nanocomposites reinforced with carbon tubes having extraordinary specific stiffness and strength represent tremendous opportunity for application in the 21st century. This paper provides a concise review of recent advances in carbon nanotubes and their composites. We examine the research work reported in the literature on the structure and processing of carbon nanotubes, as well as characterization and property modeling of carbon nanotubes and their composites.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the experimental investigation of induction heating of continuous carbon-fibre reinforced thermoplastics. The influence of the process parameters electromagnetic frequency, generator power, distance between induction coil and laminate, coil geometry and laminate lay-up on the heating rate and the heat distribution have been investigated in stationary experiments. It was found that all investigated parameters have significant influence on the heating behaviour and that a quadratic dependence is dominating. Heat is only generated when closed fibre loops exist, through which current can flow. The quality of the fibre junctions in a laminate, especially the contact length, was found to be of major importance. Thus, for example laminates with unidirectional fibre reinforcement, which do not contain fibre junctions, cannot be heated. Experimental evidence has shown that induction heating of carbon-fibre-reinforced thermoplastics is based on Joule losses.},

When the filler particles are small and metallic, a dielectric relaxation due to interfacial polarization is commonly observed at optical or smaller wavelengths. Here, experimental results are presented in which the dielectric relaxation is shifted to microwave frequencies as a result of using metal-coated dielectric particles with a nano-scale coating thickness. The results are analysed in the context of effective medium theory adapted for multi-layer particles. Such a large shift in relaxation frequency, compared with that for a similar composite with solid metal filler particles, is shown to be a function of both the coating geometry and a thin-film-related reduction in the conductivity of the metal. The observed broadening of the relaxation peak is attributed to non-uniformity of the coating thickness and a consequent distribution of coating conductivity.},

	abstract = {Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has been established as a scalable and environmentally friendly approach for depositing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from aqueous colloidal dispersions onto a variety of fibrous surfaces. EPD facilitates the micro/nano hybridization of CNTs and reinforcing fibers, enabling the controlled engineering of hierarchically-structured composites. Model studies have shown that the chemistry of the CNTs in the fiber/matrix interphase plays a critical role in the mechanical performance of the composite. Composite interphases were replicated on planar glass substrates to systematically study the influence of CNT functionalization, glass surface chemistry, and aqueous dispersion quality on the mechanical performance under shear loading. CNTs were functionalized using a novel ultrasonicated-ozonolysis (USO) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) process to prepare films on silane-treated glass surfaces. The epoxy-infused films exhibited a 50{\%} improvement as compared to untreated glass/epoxy interfaces. Detailed surface analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows chemical bonds in the interphase, and computational modeling of the valence band spectra provides additional insight into the chemical nature of the bond. The formation of a PEI–CNT rich interphase facilitates a more homogeneous, ductile fracture zone relative to the brittle glass epoxy interface, and increases composite strength by shifting the fracture surface away from the glass surface. Intentional destabilization of the CNT dispersion resulted in re-agglomeration, diminishing any benefit of the PEI, thereby demonstrating the importance of a stable dispersion provided by the USO processing. The results replicate the trends observed previously in more complex composite systems and provide new insight into interfacial engineering of nanostructured composites.},

The extended model considers electron tunneling as the effective mechanism for insulator-conductor transition. The model was validated with relevant experimental data based on a mono-nanofiller. Using the extended model, the effective electrical conductivity of a nanocomposite comprising both graphite nanoplatelets and carbon nanotubes was investigated. It was observed that the hybridized nanocomposites filled with a mixture of these conductive nanofillers attain, synergistically, enhanced electrical conductivities at lower volume fractions. The lower filler contents assist in preserving the intrinsic properties of the host polymer in support of several applications. It was also observed that the relative aspect ratios of the conductive fillers play significant roles on the electrical conductivity of the hybrid nanocomposite. Simulations revealed that, generally, the addition of minimal amounts of a higher aspect ratio auxiliary phase to a lower aspect ratio main phase enhances the electrical conductivity of the composite by orders of magnitude.},

This study is the first experimental investigation of what has been previously concluded to be the potential solution to the current widespread nanoparticle functionalization problem. This study addresses the current limiting factor, namely the cost issue, by using simple gas precursors, using an affordable initiation source and operating under normal conditions. This approach differs from the current approaches which use expensive solvents as precursors, energy consuming-sources of initiation (e.g. high temperature, plasma and VUV) and operate under high vacuum and/or high temperatures. While the current paradigm is to target the peak absorption of a molecule, the present study indicates that long chain polymerized products can be formed from off-peak wavelengths. It has been found that photo-initiated deposition occurs and that a wide range of water contact angles, from 5° to 118°, can be obtained by manipulating the experimental conditions. A multilinear empirical model has been derived, and it predicts fairly well the contact angles obtained as a function of the different experimental parameters.},

Copper and nickel powders having different particle shapes were used as fillers. The composite preparation conditions allow the formation of a random distribution of metallic particles in the polymer matrix volume for the systems ER-Cu, ER-Ni, PVC-Cu and to create ordered shell structure in the PVC-Ni system. A model is proposed to describe the shell structure electric conductivity. The percolation theory equation ?????(??-??c)t with t = 2.4-3.2 (exceeding the universal t = 1.7 value) holds true for the systems with dispersed filler random distribution, but not for the PVC-Ni system. The percolation threshold ??c depends on both particle shape and type of spatial distribution (random or ordered). In contrast to the electrical conductivity, the concentration dependence of thermal conductivity shows no jump in the percolation threshold region. For the description of the concentration dependence of the electrical and thermal conductivity, the key parameter is the packing factor F. F takes into account the influence of conductive phase topology and particle shape on the electrical and thermal conductivity. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Conductive Polymer Composite (CPC) can be considered one of the best material candidates for the bipolar plates in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells due to its balance between electrical and mechanical properties, low cost and ease of manufacturing. The development of the models has been shown to be important for predicting the electrical properties of the CPCs. The main challenge is to produce a constant electric supply in the fuel cell systems which influence the overall fuel cell performance. Generally, the classical percolation theory describes that the electrical conductivity of the polymer composite is achieved when the volume fraction of the conductive filler is above the specific value, known as percolation threshold phenomena. Current research trends using the General Effective Media (GEM) model show it is the best model to predict the electrical properties of the composite. The main advantage of using the GEM is the model can predict the electrical conductivity for multiple filler systems at high filler loadings. Numerous factors including volume fraction, shape and size, aspect ratio, critical value, and orientation are significant in developing a robust model. Controlling the filler orientations in the CPCs are important as they are able to improve the mechanical performance while enhancing the electrical conductivity of the composite. Orientation can be induced by a few methods such as shear stress, altering die and fillers aspect ratio based on the needs. By controlling the fillers direction, one is able to control both the mechanical and electrical conductivity of the CPCs. However, recent publications seem to suggest that the Fibre Contact Model (FCM) is the latest model that considers the orientation factor in predicting conductivity. A good agreement between experimental results and modelling prediction can be observed using carbon-fibre reinforced polypropylene below and above the percolation threshold. Parallel orientations of the fibres to the extrusion die direction provided better electrical conductivity compared to randomly oriented fillers. This manuscript attempts to discuss other potential models used in predicting the electrical conductivity of the CPCs.},

Both thermoset and thermoplastic matrices were used to impregnate the porous GNP paper and an extremely high tensile modulus was attained. Even with 30 vol.{\%} polymer, the GNP paper composite can still exhibit ???700 S cm -1 electrical conductivity thanks to the highly continuous GNP network formed in the paper making process. The impregnated GNP paper was also investigated as a component in carbon fiber composite.

Although the morphological control of conductive networks in CPCs has been extensively investigated as an important issue for the preparation of high performance CPCs, recent extensive progress has not been systematically addressed in any review. It has been observed that the morphological control of conductive networks during the preparation of CPCs has crucial influence on the electrical properties of these composites. Several methods have been shown to be able to control the network structure, and thus, tune the electrical properties of CPCs, including the use of shear, polymer blends, thermal annealing, mixed filler, latex particle etc. Moreover, many novel and exciting applications have been extensively investigated for CPCs, such as stretchable conductor, electroactive sensors, shape memory materials and thermoelectric materials, etc. Therefore, the morphological control of conductive network in CPCs is reviewed here. Issues regarding morphology characterization methods, morphological control methods, resulted network morphology and electrical properties are discussed. Furthermore, the use of CPCs as electroactive multifunctional materials is also reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Information security underpins many aspects of modern society. However, silicon chips are vulnerable to hazards such as counterfeiting, tampering and information leakage through side-channel attacks (for example, by measuring power consumption, timing or electromagnetic radiation). Single-walled carbon nanotubes are a potential replacement for silicon as the channel material of transistors due to their superb electrical properties and intrinsic ultrathin body, but problems such as limited semiconducting purity and non-ideal assembly still need to be addressed before they can deliver high-performance electronics. Here, we show that by using these inherent imperfections, an unclonable electronic random structure can be constructed at low cost from carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes are self-assembled into patterned HfO2 trenches using ion-exchange chemistry, and the width of the trench is optimized to maximize the randomness of the nanotube placement. With this approach, two-dimensional (2D) random bit arrays are created that can offer ternary-bit architecture by determining the connection yield and switching type of the nanotube devices. As a result, our cryptographic keys provide a significantly higher level of security than conventional binary-bit architecture with the same key size.},

The morphology and structure of the produced composites were investigated by optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopies. MWCNT incorporation into PE matrix results in the change of conductivity mechanism from conductivity typical of a system with local disorder and effects of weak interaction of electrons (quantum correction to conductivity) to conductivity that can be described within the theory of Coulomb blockade or quasi-one-dimensional variable-range hopping conductivity with variable length of hops (Mott's law) between localized states. The electromagnetic (EM) response of composites was investigated in a broadband region (118–510 GHz).

Our objective is to understand the physical mechanisms taking place in the APC-2 (carbon/PEEK) welding phenomenon in order to model and improve the process. The originality of the study was to develop a process thermal model at a macroscopic scale and simultaneously to deeply study phenomenon at a macromolecular scale. The 2D thermal model enables to simulate the ply consolidation whatever the process parameters. It takes into account heat transfers via conduction and convection plus melting and crystallisation phenomena whose kinetics were determined experimentally. Concerning macromolecular chains dynamics, reptation time relative to chain diffusion at the interface was approached by rheological tests. It has been shown that PEEK thermal degradation mechanism is mainly crosslinking; the crosslinking kinetics has been followed by ageing rheological tests. The coupling of these studies enables to predict the consolidation efficiency and to determine a good welding zone in the Time-Temperature process window. These simulations are compared to mechanical tests relative to the welded interface.

	abstract = {Non-modified Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) and polypropylene (PP) in absence of compatibilizer have been chosen to elaborate MWCNT/PP nanocomposites using a simple melt-mixing dispersing method. Calorimetry results indicate little effect of MWCNTs on crystallinity of PP, revealing not much interaction between nanotubes and PP chains, which is compatible with the employed manufacturing procedure. In any case, a hindering of polymer chains motion by MWCNTs is observed in the molten state, using oscillatory flow experiments, and a rheological percolation threshold is determined. The percolation limit is not noticed by Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT) measurements in the melt, because this technique rather detects local motions. Keeping the nanocomposites in the molten state provokes an electrical conductivity increase of several orders of magnitude, but on ulterior crystallization, the conductivity decreases, probably due to a reduction of the ionic conductivity. For a concentration of 2{\%} MWCNTs, in the limit of percolation, the conductivity decreases considerably more, because percolation network constituted in the molten state is unstable and is destroyed during crystallization.},

	abstract = {The research in this paper is an essential part of a bigger effort on developing robust sequential ultrasonic welding of multi-spot welded joints in thermoplastic composites. It mainly focused on assessing the impact of the changes in boundary conditions on the welding process and whether it could be circumvented by using an appropriate process control strategy. A two-step approach was followed by investigating: (1) the effect of boundary conditions on displacement- and energy-controlled single-spot welded joints and (2) displacement- and energy-controlled sequential ultrasonic welding of double-spot welded joints. The results showed that previous spots indeed affect the energy required to obtain an optimum new welded spot, which challenges the use of energy-controlled welding for this application. Contrarily, displacement-controlled welding was shown to provide consistent-quality welds with a constant set of welding parameters and it was hence identified as the most promising welding strategy for sequential ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composites.},

@article{Kabanemi2010,
	abstract = {A reptation-based model, that incorporates transient polymer-nanoparticle surface interactions, is proposed to describe the dynamics and rheological behaviors of linear entangled polymers filled with isotropic rigid nanoscale particles. Dispersed nanoparticles are sufficiently small such that even at low volume fractions, the average particle wall-to-wall distance is on the order of the chain size. The model predicts a scaling law in the form, $\tau$d,eff∼$\tau$d($\phi$adN+1)2, where $\tau$d,eff is the effective reptation time of a chain in the presence of attractive nanoparticles, $\tau$d is its reptation time in the neat polymer, $\phi$ad is the fraction of attached monomers per chain, and N is the number of monomers per chain. Hence, the overall relaxation is extremely retarded by attractive nanoparticles in the limit of strongly adsorbed chains. Also, it is found that the effective reptation time, $\tau$d,eff, can be controlled through five main parameters, i.e., the molecular weight of the polymer chain, N, the size of the nanoparticles, df, the density of attractive site on the nanoparticle surface, nas, the monomer-nanoparticle energetic interaction, e{\{}open{\}}, and the nanoparticle volume fraction, $\phi$f. The nonequilibrium dynamics of detachment/re-attachment of monomers from/to nanoparticle surfaces under flow conditions is incorporated in the model to elucidate the effect of monomer-surface interactions on the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. The resulting model correctly captures the linear dynamical properties and shear rheological behaviors of nanocomposite systems studied. Under very slow shear flow conditions, these filled systems exhibit a strong non-Newtonian behavior and a large enhancement in the viscosity as a certain number of monomers in the chain are attached to nanoparticle surfaces, while at very high shear rates, the neat polymer dominates the shear thinning behavior, suggesting that addition of nanoparticles contributes negligible to the viscosity in strong flows. A picture that is based on transient polymer-particle surface interactions, i.e., the detachment/re-attachment dynamics of monomers from/to nanoparticle surfaces is proposed to interpret the observed huge alteration in rheological properties. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

	abstract = {Conductive polymer composites (CPCs) have generated significant academic and industrial interest for several decades. Unfortunately, ordinary CPCs with random conductive networks generally require high conductive filler loadings at the insulator/conductor transition, requiring complex processing and exhibiting inferior mechanical properties and low economic affordability. Segregated CPC (s-CPC) contains conductive fillers that are segregated in the perimeters of the polymeric granules instead of being randomly distributed throughout the bulk CPC material; these materials are overwhelmingly superior compared to normal CPCs. For example, the s-CPC materials have an ultralow percolation concentration (0.005-0.1 vol{\%}), superior electrical conductivity (up to 106 S/m), and reasonable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (above 20 dB) at low filler loadings. Therefore, considerable progress has been achieved with s-CPCs, including high-performance anti-static, EMI shielding and sensing materials. Currently, however, few systematic reviews summarizing these advances with s-CPCs are available. To understand and efficiently harness the abilities of s-CPCs, we attempted to review the major advances available in the literature. This review begins with a concise and general background on the morphology and fabrication methods of s-CPCs. Next, we investigate the ultralow percolation behaviors of and the elements exerting a relevant influence (e.g., conductive filler type, host polymers, dispersion methods, etc.) on s-CPCs. Moreover, we also briefly discussed the latest advances in the mechanical, sensing, thermoelectric and EMI shielding properties of the s-CPCs. Finally, an overview of the current challenges and tasks of s-CPC materials is provided to guide the future development of these promising materials. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of composites were determined by Modulated-Temperature Differential Scanning Calorimetry and analysed as a function of particles volume content and temperature. The specific heat capacity of the composites decreases with increasing silver particles content below the electrical percolation threshold. Above the electrical percolation threshold the specific heat capacity decreases more slowly and converge toward the specific heat capacity of compressed silver nanoparticles. The evolution of the thermal conductivity with filler content exhibits a non-linear profile. Experimental data are coherent with the Maxwell model suggesting continuity of the polymer matrix and a contribution of the silver particles to the effective thermal conductivity greater than volume effect. The temperature dependence of the composites thermal conductivity is characteristic of amorphous phase, while a transition from vitreous-like to crystalline-like behaviour of the specific heat capacity is observed with the introduction of metallic particles.},

Processing techniques such as direct, sonication, shear, and combined sonication and shear mixing techniques were employed in the fabrication of nanocomposites. It was found that both sonication and shear mixing produced in situ nanosize graphite sheets from EG. However, the occurrence of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks at 2$\theta$ = 26.38° (d0 0 2 = 3.37 {\AA}) irrespective of processing technique confirmed the presence of graphite nanosheets in multilayer rather than a single layer form. The mechanical behavior of the nanocomposites was investigated as a function of particle concentration and processing technique. It was found that EG reinforced nanocomposites showed higher elastic modulus than neat epoxy. However, nanocomposites prepared with the aid of shear mixing provided the best exfoliation and dispersion of graphite nanosheets and as a consequence, the best modulus enhancement over other processing techniques. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper starts with the structural and intrinsic mechanical properties of VGCNFs. Then the major factors (filler dispersion and distribution, filler aspect ratio, adhesion and interface between filler and polymer matrix) affecting the mechanical properties of VGCNF/polymer composites are presented. After that, VGCNF/polymer composite mechanical properties are discussed in terms of nanofibers dispersion and alignment, adhesion between the nanofiber and polymer matrix, and other factors. The influence of processing methods and processing conditions on the properties of VGCNF/polymer composite is also considered. At the end, the possible future challenges for VGCNF and VGCNF/polymer composites are highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Noble-metal-coated carbon-based nanoparticles, when used as electrically conductive fillers, have the potential to provide excellent conductivity without the high weight and cost normally associated with metals such as silver and gold. To this effect, many attempts were made to deposit uniform metallic layers on core nanoparticles with an emphasis on silver for its high conductivity. The results so far were disheartening with the metal morphology being better described as a decoration than a coating with small effects on the electrical conductivity of the bulk particles. We tackled in this work the specific problem of electroless deposition of silver on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with the investigation of every step of the process. We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM, SEM), zeta potential, and electrical conductivity measurements to identify a repeatable, reliable set of parameters allowing for a uniform and fully connected silver deposition on the surface of the CNFs. The bulk particles' specific electrical conductivity (conductivity per unit mass) undergoes a more than 10-fold increase during the deposition, reaching 2500 S.cm2/g, which indicates that the added metal mass participates efficiently to the conduction network. The particles keep their high aspect ratio through the process, which enables a percolated conduction network at very low volume loadings in a composite. No byproducts are produced during the reaction so the particles do not have to be sorted or purified and can be used as produced after the short approximately 15 min reaction time. The particles might be an interesting replacement to conventional fillers in isotropic conductive adhesives, as a conductive network is obtained at a much lower loading. They might also serve as electrically conductive fillers in composites where a high conductivity is needed, such as lightning strike protection systems, or as high surface area silver electrodes.},

Amorphous PEEK was thermally annealed to produce a range of crystallinities, and its dielectric properties were measured. As the crystalline/amorphous ratio of the polymer increased, the dielectric breakdown strength was reduced. The electrical conductivity of the material was also shown to decrease with increasing crystallinity. The effect on the permittivity was inconclusive},

All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

We review the size-dependent properties of a variety of inorganic nanoparticles and find that particles larger than about 30 nm do not in general show properties that would require regulatory scrutiny beyond that required for their bulk counterparts.},

	abstract = {In this paper various deterministic and statistical models, based on new quantized theories proposed by the author, are presented for estimating the strength of a real, and thus defective, space elevator cable. The cable, ∼100 000 km in length, is composed of carbon nanotubes, ∼100 nm long: thus, its design involves nanomechanics and megamechanics. The predicted strengths are extensively compared with the experimental and atomistic simulation results for carbon nanotubes available in the literature. All these approaches unequivocally suggest that the megacable strength will be reduced by a factor at least of ∼70{\%} with respect to the theoretical nanotube strength, today (erroneously) assumed in the cable design. The reason is the unavoidable presence of defects in so huge a cable. Preliminary in-silicon tensile experiments confirm the same finding. The deduced strength reduction is sufficient to place in doubt the effective realization of the space elevator, that if built as designed today will certainly break (in the author's opinion). The mechanics of the cable is also revised and possible damage sources discussed.},

	abstract = {The thermal degradation mechanisms of poly[2,2′-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenylpropane-2-phenylenediimide] (PEI) have been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and by direct pyrolysis mass spectrometry (DPMS). TG data show that PEI has a main decomposition step centred at about 510°C followed by a less marked step in the 600-650°C temperature range and leaving about 60{\%} of charred residue at 800°C. The total ion curve (TIC) of a purified PEI sample, obtained by DPMS, closely reproduces the two maxima appearing in the deriv ative TG (DTG) curve, whereas the TIC curve of a crude PEI sample shows two less pronounced maxima in the temperature range of 250-450°C due to low molar mass compounds, which volatilize undecomposed in the high vacuum of the MS. The structure of the pyrolysis compounds obtained in the first thermal degradation step of a purified PEI sample suggest that they are mainly formed by the scission of: i) the isopropylidene bridge of bisphenol A; ii) the oxygen-phthalimide bond; iii) the phenyl-phthalimide bond, which are apparently the weakest bonds of PEI. Extensive hydrogen transfer reactions and subsequent condensation reactions may account for the high amount of char residue. The pyrolysis compounds obtained in the second degradation step (620°C) are mainly constituted of CO 2 , benzene, aniline, benzonintrile, phenylenediamine, and dibenzonitrile, which may be generated by further thermal degradation reactions of pyrolysis compounds containing N - H phthalimide as end groups. Another degradation processes which may account for CO 2  formation is the hydrolysis of the imide moiety to form poly(amic acid) units which produce an aromatic amide structure by decarboxylation. The pyrolysis of an aromatic polyamide (NOMEX) was then studied for comparison. The structure of the pyrolysis products detected by the DPMS analysis of both polymers allowed a detailed schematization of the thermal degradation pathways involved in the degradation of PEI and on the reactions leading to the formation of the charred residue. {\textcopyright} WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim 1999.},

	abstract = {Thermoplastic polymer industry has expanded a new impact with the introduction of Eco-friendly thermoplastic matrix composites (TPCs), which finds applications in medical, aerospace, electronic and automotive areas. Joints of non-conductive thermoplastic composite materials are processed by Resistance Welding (RW) by incorporating a conductive corrosion resistive conductive material, as an interlayer. Glass fiber reinforced polypropylene thermoplastic composite sheets were used for this study. The experimental set-up for resistance welding was fabricated. Welding current, clamping pressure and welding duration (Time) are the control parameters. The joining trials on composites were carried out using Taguchi method to reduce time and cost effective experimental studies. The effect of parameters which govern the quality of resistance welding of thermoplastic composites is also emphasized in this work. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimum process parameters for RW. The joints obtained were analyzed microscopically; it revealed the good integration of thermoplastic composite with the interlayer material. The mechanical strength of the joints is tested through lap shear strength testing.},

For the experimental analysis, EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of MWCNT/polypropylene (PP) composite plates made in three different thicknesses and at four different concentrations were studied. A model based on the shielding of electromagnetic plane wave was used to theoretically study the EMI shielding mechanisms. The experimental results showed that absorption is the major shielding mechanism and reflection is the secondary shielding mechanism. The modeling results demonstrated that multiple-reflection within MWCNT internal surfaces and between MWCNT external surfaces decrease the overall EMI SE. The EMI SE of MWCNT/PP composites increased with increase in MWCNT content and shielding plate thickness. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The fracture surfaces were generated with the complete breakdown of the specimens under the same conditions used in the mechanical test. The fractographic aspects of fracture surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM analyzes allowed evaluating the interfacial adhesion of fiber/matrix and matrix/heating element (a stainless steel mesh). All laminates showed a well-consolidated composite fracture surfaces, exhibiting cusps, river lines aspects and fibers recovered by a thin layer of polymeric matrix. This latter aspect indicates a strong fiber/matrix interfacial adhesion associated to the presence of voids. Moreover, the matrix/heating element interfacial adhesion was effective only in the laminates with higher lap shear strength values. In these cases, a good adhesion of the matrix was observed in the heating element. The highest strength values determined are attributed to the interdiffusion mechanism of the polymeric chains in the welded region of joints and also to the mechanical anchoring of polymer on the heating element surface. It was also observed the presence of matrix regions with globular aspects indicating unexpected effort in mode I during the lap shear strength test.},

Measurements on randomly oriented MWCNTs and SWCNTs were made by depositing a thin film of CNTs within a calorimetric cell. Anisotropic measurements were made on MWCNTs grown inside the highly ordered, densely packed nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide. The specific heat of randomly oriented MWCNTs and SWCNTs showed similar behavior to the specific heat of bulk graphite powder. However, the specific heat of aligned MWCNTs is smaller and has weaker temperature dependence than that of the bulk above room temperature. The effective thermal conductivity of randomly oriented MWCNTs and SWCNTs is similar to that of powder graphite, exhibiting a maximum value near 364 K indicating the onset of phonon-phonon scattering. The effective thermal conductivity of the anisotropic MWCNTs increased smoothly with increasing temperature and is indicative of the one-dimensional nature of the heat flow.},

CNTs were functionalized using ball milling in the presence of ammonium bicarbonate, followed by reduction of silver ions in N, N-dimethylformamide, producing silver decorated CNTs (Ag@CNTs). The Ag@CNTs were employed as conducting filler in epoxy resin to fabricate electrically conducting polymer composites. The electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of the composites were measured and compared with those containing pristine and functionalized CNTs. It was found that when pH was about six, highly dispersed Ag-NPs can be decorated on functionalized CNTs. The electrical conductivity of composites containing 0.10 wt{\%} of Ag@CNTs was more than four orders of magnitude higher than those containing same content of pristine and functionalized CNTs, confirming the advantage of the Ag@CNTs as effective conducting filler. The ameliorating effect of improved electrical conductivity was not at the expense of thermal or mechanical properties. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Characterization and purification studies have been performed on the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), prepared by the large-scale (i.e., at production rates of similar to 100 g h(-1)) induction thermal plasma process. The main impurities present in the as-produced soot materials are first identified by various material analyses and turn out to be amorphous carbon, graphitic carbon particles, and metal/metal-oxide catalysts, but without significant content of fullerenes. In particular, the amounts of graphitic particles present were high in comparison with those of other plasma arc or laser-grown SWNTs, and it is believed that these graphitic particles mainly originate from the remains of the feedstock materials. On the basis of this observation, different purification protocols have been explored by combining the two-step processes of thermal oxidation in air and liquid oxidation in a variety of acids. At each step of the purification, the changes in the SWNT samples are monitored by various analytical techniques, and the results reveal that the air oxidation at 350 degrees C for 1h, followed by refluxing in 7 M HNO3 for 6 h, provides for the best efficiency in conducting the purification of the thermal plasma-grown SWNT. The material properties of the purified samples, such as the electrical resistivity and the specific surface area (SSA), have also been analyzed by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the four-probe methods, the measured values being similar to 500 m(2) g(-1) and similar to 2 x 10(-3) Omega cm, respectively},

As the CNTs are highly conductive and predominantly aligned along the draw direction, by controlling the aspect ratio of these CNTs and the number of stacked web layers, a tailored resistance can be achieved. Layers of CNT web are compared to plies of carbon fiber (CF), as the heating elements within a glass fiber laminate assembly. Compared with the CF-heater as well as existing state-of-the-art heating systems, the highly aligned CNT-web-heater possesses negligible weight (e.g. compared with eight CF plies (3633.8 g m−2), an equivalent 20-CNT-web heater (0.38 g m−2) is ∼104times lighter), rapid and uniform heating, efficient energy consumption and its electro-thermal behaviour can be tuned to suit any surface and power requirement to achieve rapid anti-icing/de-icing. Both anti-icing and de-icing performance have been verified and in particular, for de-icing, with a constant 4.9 kW m−2power supply, the GF laminate with 40 layers of CNT web could remove accreted ice within 15 s.},

	abstract = {New poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) based composites have been fabricated by the incorporation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using melt processing. Their structure, morphology, thermal and mechanical properties have been investigated. Scanning electron microscopy observations demonstrated a more uniform distribution of the CNTs for samples prepared following a processing route based on polymer ball milling and CNT dispersion in ethanol media. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated a remarkable improvement in the thermal stability of the matrix by the incorporation of SWCNTs. Differential scanning calorimetry showed a decrease in the crystallization temperature with increasing SWCNT content, whilst no significant changes were observed in the melting of the composites. The crystallite size determined by X-ray diffraction decreased at high SWCNT loading, which is attributed to the spatial limitations on crystal growth by confinement within the CNT network. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed an increase in the storage moduli, hence in the rigidity of the systems, with increasing SWCNT content. Their addition shifts the glass transition peak to higher temperatures due to the restriction in chain mobility imposed by the CNTs. Higher thermal stability and mechanical strength were found for composites with improved dispersion of the SWCNTs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Autohesion (direct-bonding or self-bonding) is the formation of bonds between two surfaces of an identical polymer at elevated temperature (usually just above Tg). It is an emerging technique that has the potential to cleanly and precisely join/bond polymers without the need for adhesives. Autohesion is particularly useful for applications that require hermetic and precise polymer bonding, such as in microfluidics, MEMS, and in the encapsulation of active medical implants. This article discusses the latest debate on the main mechanisms proposed to explain autohesion of polymers such as diffusion, crystalline growth, thermodynamic and chemical bonding. Surface activation techniques that are used to facilitate autohesion such as plasma treatment, chemicals, UV and ozone treatments are explored. In addition, topics such as molecular characteristics of polymers that influence autohesion, limits to bonding strength and hermetic bonding are critically discussed. Methods for evaluating autohesion strength of polymers are also described. Comparisons between prediction models from different research groups with experimental values for authohesive bonding strength are shown. Finally, conclusions and suggestions for further research are presented.},

Coating is a new compounding method proposed in this research, where xGnP and PP powder are premixed in isopropyl alcohol using sonication to disperse the xGnP by coating individual PP powder particles. It is found that the coating method is more effective than the polymer solution method widely used, in terms of lowering the percolation threshold of thermoplastic nanocomposites, and enhancing the probability that the large platelet morphology of xGnP can be preserved in the final composite. The research reported here provides an understanding on how the compounding method used during the fabrication of nanocomposites is important to achieving the optimal flexural properties, electrical conductivity and percolation threshold. This method should have wide applicability to all thermoplastic matrix nanocomposite systems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A special specimen geometry, the skin/stringer configuration, was used to represent a typical reinforced aerospace structural joint. The specimens consisted of a flange, representing a stringer or frame, welded onto a skin laminate. The effects of the welding parameters such as the input power level and clamping distance on the weld quality and performance were investigated. The welding parameters were optimised using short beam shear tests, ultrasonic C-scan inspection and optical microscopy. The mechanical performance of the resistance-welded skin/stringer configuration was investigated using three- and four-point bending tests and the failure mechanisms were characterised by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Two methods were used to reduce the stress concentration at the flange tip. The first method was to machine a 20° taper angle at the edge of the flange and the second one was to create a resin fillet at the flange tip. No mechanical performance improvement was obtained with the resin fillet method but the taper angle method showed 25{\%} mechanical performance improvement when the taper angles were machined after the welding operation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In this work two types of montmorillonite, a pristine and an organo-modified clay (Cloisite 30B), were employed to produce (polyethylene terephthalate)-based nanocomposites via in situ polymerization. Using water as an intermediate medium, a stable dispersion of pristine clay in ethylene glycol was achieved. However, after polymerization, no significant gain was obtained in terms of delamination of silicate platelets. The polycondensation reaction when using Cloisite 30B was carried out at a temperature as low as 250°C in order to retain a considerable portion of the organo-modifier. The results showed that Cloisite 30B was successfully intercalated by the polymer chains, resulting in a d-spacing increase from 1.9 nm to about 3.6 nm. Although some mono and double silicate layers were observed in microscopy images, the major part of the organoclay remained in a tactoid intercalated form. Sampling during the polycondensation reaction revealed that, in this process, clay was first swelled efficiently by the monomer, and this structure was preserved in the early stage of polycondensation. However, the silicate platelets collapsed with time as the polycondensation progressed and larger molecular weight oligomers were formed. An investigation on the type of impeller used in the polymerization process showed that a slight improvement was achieved in terms of aggregate size and distribution when the anchor impeller was replaced by a helical one.},

	abstract = {Current leakage is a concern with resistance welding of carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites. This phenomenon is particularly important when unidirectional adherends, with the carbon fibres parallel to the electrical current direction, are welded. In this investigation, a new electrically-insulated heating element consisting of a ceramic-coated (TiO2) stainless steel mesh was developed to prevent current leakage. Special specimen geometry, called a skin/stringer configuration, was welded with this newly developed heating element to represent typical reinforced aerospace structures. The adherends were made of APC-2/AS4 (carbon fibre/PEEK) composites. Unidirectional specimens, which represent the most critical case, were first welded using the new heating element. The insulated heating element successfully prevented current leakage and showed great improvement in temperature homogeneity over the weld area. The impact of the new heating element on the mechanical performance of the welds was then assessed by welding quasi-isotropic specimens. The mechanical performances of quasi-isotropic specimens welded using the new insulated heating elements and conventional (non-insulated) ones were compared under short beam and three-point bending tests. No mechanical performance drawback was observed with the new heating element; however, the failure mode of the welded quasi-isotropic specimens was changed from a delamination in the skin laminate failure to a weld interface debonding failure. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets or buckypapers have demonstrated promising electrical conductivity and mechanical performance. However, their electrical conductivity is still far below the requirements for engineering applications, such as using as a substitute for copper mesh, which is currently used in composite aircraft structures for lightning strike protection. In this study, different CNT buckypapers were stretched to increase their alignment, and then subjected to conjugational cross-linking via chemical functionalization. The conjugationally cross-linked buckypapers (CCL-BPs) demonstrated higher electrical conductivity of up to 6200 S cm( - 1), which is more than one order increase compared to the pristine buckypapers. The CCL-BPs also showed excellent doping stability in over 300 h in atmosphere and were resistant to degradation at elevated temperatures. The tensile strength of the stretched CCL-BPs reached 220 MPa, which is about three times that of pristine buckypapers. We attribute these property improvements to the effective and stable conjugational cross-links of CNTs, which can simultaneously improve the electrical conductivity, doping stability and mechanical properties. Specifically, the electrical conductivity increase resulted from improving the CNT alignment and inter-tube electron transport capability. The conjugational cross-links provide effective 3D conductive paths to increase the mobility of electrons among individual nanotubes. The stable covalent bonding also enhances the thermal stability and load transfer. The significant electrical and mechanical property improvement renders buckypaper a multifunctional material for various applications, such as conducting composites, battery electrodes, capacitors, etc.},

Over the life span of a wind turbine, the static and fatigue loads in varying environmental conditions can lead to cracking and/or debonding of the adhesive joints, ultimately leading to blade structural collapse. The objective of this work is to investigate fusion joining of wind turbine blades manufactured using thermoplastic resin. Thermoplastic resins for wind turbine blades can reduce cycle times and energy consumption during manufacturing and facilitate end-of-life recycling and on-site manufacturing. Additionally, fusion joining of these materials can replace adhesives, resulting in stronger and more robust blades. This work showed that, compared to typical adhesives used in wind turbine blades, fusion welding resulted in an increase in both the static and fatigue lap-shear strength as compared to bonded thermoplastic composite coupons. This initial coupon-scale research suggests that there is potential for developing fusion welding techniques for full-scale wind turbine blades.},

Unidirectional (UD) and quasi-isotropic adherends were welded using stainless steel meshes as heating elements. The specimen geometry consisted of a flange laminate, representing a stringer, welded onto a skin laminate. In order to avoid current leakage to the electrically conductive adherends, a ceramic-coated heating element (TiO2 HE) was used for welding the UD specimens and some of the quasi-isotropic specimens. The fatigue performance of the welded joints was investigated under three-point bending. An indefinite fatigue life was obtained at 40{\%} and 35{\%} of the static damage initiation load for the UD and quasi-isotropic specimens, respectively. The failure mechanisms were documented based on observation of the fatigue cracks initiation and growth. UD specimens failed at the weld interface while quasi-isotropic specimens showed delaminations both in the flange or skin laminates and at the weld interface. The TiO2 HE did not show any fatigue mechanical performance reduction. However, debonding at the weld interface was shown to occur between the metal mesh wires and the TiO2 coating instead of between the laminates and the weld. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing analyses of single idealized contacts are summarized and compared, and then applied, together with results of recent electrolytic analog tests, to predict the conductance of multiple contacts. "appropriately" or "inappropriately" distributed at the interface. Reconsideration of the theory of interaction between randomly rough surfaces shows how the parameters required to predict heat transfer can be determined in principle by simple manipulation of typical profiles of the mating surface, together with an approximation from deformation theory. It is also shown that this process depends more crucially than had been realized upon the distribution of the few high peaks of the surfaces, where the assumption of Gaussian distribution of heights is suspect. In place of that assumption, the use of describing functions is suggested. The few experimental data relevant to these theories are examined and compared with predictions of theory. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

@article{Villegas2016,
	abstract = {This paper presents a novel straightforward method for ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic-composite coupons in optimum processing conditions. The ultrasonic welding process described in this paper is based on three main pillars. Firstly, flat energy directors are used for preferential heat generation at the joining interface during the welding process. A flat energy director is a neat thermoplastic resin film that is placed between the parts to be joined prior to the welding process and heats up preferentially owing to its lower compressive stiffness relative to the composite substrates. Consequently, flat energy directors provide a simple solution that does not require molding of resin protrusions on the surfaces of the composite substrates, as opposed to ultrasonic welding of unreinforced plastics. Secondly, the process data provided by the ultrasonic welder is used to rapidly define the optimum welding parameters for any thermoplastic composite material combination. Thirdly, displacement control is used in the welding process to ensure consistent quality of the welded joints. According to this method, thermoplastic-composite flat coupons are individually welded in a single lap configuration. Mechanical testing of the welded coupons allows determining the apparent lap shear strength of the joints, which is one of the properties most commonly used to quantify the strength of thermoplastic composite welded joints.

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes have been the subject of considerable attention because of their exceptional physical and mechanical properties. These properties observed at the nanoscale have motivated researchers to utilize carbon nanotubes as reinforcement in composite materials. In this research, a micro-scale twin-screw extruder was used to achieve dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in a polystyrene matrix. Highly aligned nanocomposite films were produced by extruding the polymer melt through a rectangular die and drawing the film prior to cooling. Randomly oriented nanocomposites were produced by achieving dispersion first with the twin-screw extruder followed by pressing a film using a hydraulic press. The tensile behaviour of the aligned and random nanocomposite films with 5 wt.{\%} loading of nanotubes were characterized. Addition of nanotubes increased the tensile modulus, yield strength and ultimate strengths of the polymer films, and the improvement in elastic modulus with the aligned nanotube composite is five times greater than the improvement for the randomly oriented composite.},

	abstract = {The production of high quality single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on a bulk scale has been an issue of considerable interest. Recently, it has been demonstrated that high quality SWCNTs can be continuously synthesized on large scale by using induction thermal plasma technology. In this process, the high energy density of the thermal plasma is employed to generate dense vapor-phase precursors for the synthesis of SWCNTs. With the current reactor system, a carbon soot product which contains approximately 40 wt{\%} of SWCNTs can be continuously synthesized at the high production rate of 100 g/h. In this article, our recent research efforts to achieve major advances in this technology are presented. Firstly, the processing parameters involved are examined systematically in order to evaluate their individual influences on the SWCNT synthesis. Based on these results, the appropriate operating conditions of the induction thermal plasma process for an effective synthesis of SWCNTs are discussed. A characterization study has also been performed on the SWCNTs produced under the optimum processing conditions. Finally, a mathematical model of the process currently under development is described. The model will help us to better understand the synthesis of SWCNTs in the induction plasma process.},

Single-fiber composites were fabricated to examine the influence of local nanotube reinforcement on load transfer at the fiber/matrix interface. Results of the single-fiber composite tests indicate that the nanocomposite reinforcement improves interfacial load transfer. Selective reinforcement by nanotubes at the fiber/matrix interface likely results in local stiffening of the polymer matrix near the fiber/matrix interface, thus, improving load transfer.},

A low percentage of nanosized conductive carbon filler (carbon black and graphite) or ions (Li+, Na+ and K +) was filled into the tunnelling phase of expanded graphite (EG) sheets, by which electron transport was enhanced across the junctions of EG sheets and a significant increase in the electrical conductivity of the composites was achieved. In this report, polyethylene (PE) and polyethersulphone (PES) were selected as model materials. The results indicated that for the EG/PE composite the conductive peculation threshold was less than 2 wt{\%} and its conductivity increased three orders of magnitude with the addition of only 1 wt{\%} nanofiller compared with the EG/PE composite. By introducing a very small amount of Li+ or Na+ (0.06 wt{\%} related to EG) the electrical conductivity was further enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to the EG/PES composite. Experimental results were well understood by the theoretical study of the electron transport behaviour in the EG/polymer composites. The gaps between graphite sheets in the matrix must be no larger than 10 nm if the EG/PE composite is to become electrically conductive. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{McKnight1997,
	abstract = {Resistance welding has been demonstrated as a viable technique for joining thermoplastic composites. Extensive research has been conducted in previous studies on the processing and postprocessing evaluation of coupon-sized resistance welded specimens using this thermoplastic fusion bonding technique. This work focuses on the manufacturing and evaluation of large-scale resistance welds used to join carbon fiber (CF)/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) thermoplastic composite parts. Applications using the present resistance welding technology are assessed, and potential applications of resistance welding are discussed. The sequential resistance welding process is introduced as an approach to large-scale welding that increases joint quality and performance while maintaining modest pressure and weld power requirements. The single-step and alternate multiple-step (sequential) techniques are implemented for large-scale resistance welds of CF/PEEK adherends comolded with polyetherimide (PEI) (i.e., the Thermabond{\textregistered} process). Nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, mechanical testing, fractography, and microscopy show that: (1) a higher weld uniformity was obtained with the multiple-step weld than the single-step weld; and (2) uneven heating and overheating were minimized by reducing the heating element length within the bond region through the use of the sequential resistance welding process. The different welding techniques produce a large variation in lap shear strength; direct comparison of the weld quality and lap shear strength shows that the sequential resistance welding process yields a superior bond. With the principles developed in this investigation, resistance welding can be used to join large-scale thermoplastic composite parts with consistent, high levels of performance and quality.},

In this material, well-defined CNT/PC microfibrils were generated in PE matrix, and almost all CNTs were preferably localized in the PC microfibrils. There was simultaneously an increase in the strength, modulus, and elongation at break of the CNT-MRC in two directions (horizontal and vertical), which defined this new CNT reinforced composite to be isotropic.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit excellent mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties as well as nanometer scale diameter and high aspect ratio, which make them an ideal reinforcing agent for high strength polymer composites. However, since CNTs usually form stabilized bundles due to Van der Waals interactions, are extremely difficult to disperse and align in a polymer matrix. The biggest issues in the preparation of CNT-reinforced composites reside in efficient dispersion of CNTs into a polymer matrix, the assessment of the dispersion, and the alignment and control of the CNTs in the matrix. There are several methods for the dispersion of nanotubes in the polymer matrix such as solution mixing, melt mixing, electrospinning, in-situ polymerization and chemical functionalization of the carbon nanotubes, etc. These methods and preparation of high performance CNT-polymer composites are described in this review. A critical comparison of various CNT functionalization methods is given. In particular, CNT functionalization using click chemistry and the preparation of CNT composites employing hyperbranched polymers are stressed as potential techniques to achieve good CNT dispersion. In addition, discussions on mechanical, thermal, electrical, electrochemical and optical properties and applications of polymer/CNT composites are included.},

A three-dimensional transient finite element model (FEM) featuring heat transfer, consolidation and thermal degradation was used for simulating the process. A hybrid interlayer made of a glass fibre (GF) fabric essentially impregnated with PEI on one side and with epoxy resin on the other side was produced to provide mechanical interlocking between the thermoplastic (TP) and the thermosetting (TS) systems. The 'optimal' resistance welding time based on the maximum lap shear strength (LSS) was determined for three power levels and correlated to the time required to achieve bonding predicted by the FEM. Consolidation quality and failure mechanisms were discussed in relation with processing parameters. Experimental and simulated processing windows were constructed and correlated to each other. However, thermal degradation as predicted by the model did not correlate to a reduction in performance of the joint. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the process of induction welding of thermoplastic composites. The main objective is to provide a deeper insight into the nature of the induction welding process and to summarise the investigative effort that was put into it by a large group of researchers. The main focus is put on the types of heat generation mechanisms during the induction heating process and the parameters that govern the welding process (frequency, power, pressure, residence time), as well as on the secondary phenomena that can influence the quality of the weld. An over-view of the experimental procedure is also presented, with an emphasis on the experimental set-up. Finally, a brief overview of the modelling of the heat generation mechanisms and the induction welding process is presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Evaluation of the mechanical composite properties revealed a linear increase in tensile stiffness and strength with nanofibre loading fractions up to 15wt{\%} while matrix ductility was maintained up to 10wt{\%}. Electron microscopy confirmed the homogeneous dispersion and alignment of nanofibres. An interpretation of the composite performance by short-fibre theory resulted in rather low intrinsic stiffness properties of the vapour-grown CNF. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that an interaction between matrix and the nanoscale filler could occur during processing. Such changes in polymer morphology due to the presence of a nanoscale filler need to be considered when evaluating the mechanical properties of such nanocomposites. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Schell2009,
	abstract = {A fundamental characteristic of composite materials is that the initial choice of fiber and matrix type together with the selected manufacturing process controls the properties of the final part. As the manufacturing process creates simultaneously the composite and the component, its influence on part quality must be considered. From a manufacturing point of view, considering equipment, energy costs and production rate, it is desirable to process the part at the lowest possible pressures and temperatures and with the shortest cycle times. The challenge consists of making the production process robust for economical manufacture by an improved understanding of the material/process/property relationships. This paper focuses on the computational and experimental analysis of fusion bonding in thermoplastic composites. The influence of the process parameters on the bond strength is investigated. The bond quality exhibits randomness, which may be problematic within an industrial context. Its origin has been explained through a simple probabilistic analysis. The process sequence is found to be a major source of this uncertainty, resulting in various thermal loading and bonding quality fluctuations. On this basis, three practical ways for quality improvement are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research explored the potential of using exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets, GNP, as the conductive filler to construct highly conductive polymeric nanocomposites to substitute for conventional metallic and graphite bipolar plates in the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) was selected as the polymer matrix because of its high thermal and chemical tolerance. Solid state ball milling (SSBM) followed by compression molding was then applied to fabricate PPS/GNP nanocomposites. Results showed that PPS/GNP nanocomposites made by this method exhibit excellent mechanical and gas barrier properties but unsatisfied electrical conductivity. However, it was found that the electrical conductivity of these nanocomposites could be substantially enhanced if we combine GNP with second minor conductive filler for a positive synergistic effect and also optimize the processing time of SSBM. Meanwhile, PPS impregnated GNP papers were embedded into these PPS/GNP nanocomposites in order to further improve various properties of the resulting bipolar plates. It is believed that the bipolar plates made from PPS/GNP nanocomposites will allow lighter weight of PEM fuel cells with enhanced performance which is particularly suited for automotive applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a conductive film of silver nanoparticles (nAg) as a novel heating element type, called susceptor, was developed and tested for induction welding of carbon fiber/polyphenylene sulfide (CF/PPS) thermoplastic composites, i.e., unidirectional pre-impregnated 16 plies of CF/PPS compression-molded in a quasi-isotropic stacking sequence. The nAg were synthesized, dispersed in deionized (DI) water and casted onto a pure PPS film, resulting in a conductive film upon the evaporation of DI water and thermal post-annealing. The thermal annealing at 250 °C significantly (by 7 orders) decreased the film's electrical resistivity from 9.4 × 103 down to 3.1 × 10-4 $\Omega$ cm. The new susceptors led to fast heating rates in induction welding when compared to the standard stainless steel mesh susceptors under similar welding conditions. Lap shear mechanical testing revealed that the apparent lap shear strength (LSS) is sensitive to the susceptors' resistivity and the input current. A relatively high LSS value was achieved for the specimens welded using the new susceptors which exceeded the value of those welded using stainless steel mesh susceptors (28.3 MPa compared to 20 MPa). The weld interface and specimens' cross-section observation revealed that the nAg were dispersed and embedded into the resin upon welding. This study contains preliminary results that show high potential of nanoparticles as effective susceptors to further improve the mechanical performance of the joints in welding of thermoplastic composites. {\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The first step of the process consists of exfoliating NTs in an aqueous surfactant solution. This step can be monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Four experimental techniques have been developed in order to determine the minimum amount of surfactant, which is necessary to reach the highest degree of exfoliation of the NTs. The key step of this latex-based process is mixing a stable dispersion of NTs, covered by surfactant molecules, with a polymer latex. The use of this technology results in conductive nanocomposites with a low percolation threshold. Several procedures were explored in order to improve the properties of the materials, like tuning the characteristics of the polymer matrix.},

Ethylene diamine (EDA) functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-EDA) are first decorated with silver nanoparticles. These Ag/ MWCNT-EDA fillers are then coated with a conductive layer of ethylene glycol treated PEDOT: PSS (poly [3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene]: poly [styrenesulfonate]) (EP). In such an approach, the MWCNT backbone is covered by a highly conductive coating made of Ag nanoparticles surrounded by EP. To understand how Ag and EP form a highly conductive coating, the effect of different wt{\%} of Ag nanoparticles on EP was studied. Ag nanoparticles around the size of 128 ?? 28 nmeffectively lowered the volume resistivity of bulk EP, resulting in a highly conducting Ag/EP blend. We found that in the final Ag/MWCNT-EDA/EP assembly, the EP coating enhances the electrical conductivity in two ways: (1) it is an efficient dispersing agent that helps in achieving a uniform dispersion of the Ag/MWCNT-EDA and (2) it acts as a conductive bridge between particles (Ag and MWCNT-EDA), reducing the particle to particle resistivity. When inserted into polycarbonate, this three-phase blend successfully reduced the volume resistivity of the polymer by two orders of magnitude compared with previous approaches.},

However we show, by considering elliptical particles, that the sizing and shapes of the discrete particles can change the overall appearance of the system, without the underlying mechanisms changing.

Commonly, such materials are formed using ferromagnetic filler particles and rely on the phenomenon of ferromagnetic resonance for absorption of microwaves. Dielectric loss at microwave frequencies can be engineered through creating a phase lag, with respect to the applied electric field, of the movement of free charges in a composite formed using metal-coated filler particles. These materials can be engineered to be less dense and, therefore, more lightweight than those formed with ferromagnetic fillers, which is an advantage in some applications. Furthermore, theory shows that the frequency of maximum absorption can be tailored by selecting the conductivity and thickness of the particle coating although, in practice, it may be difficult to fabricate particles with tightly controlled physical parameters. In this work, theories for calculating complex permittivity of composites with layered filler particles are reviewed, and experimental observations of dielectric relaxation in composites formed by dispersing tungsten-coated glass bubbles in paraffin wax are shown},

	abstract = {Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and its variants, is a more viable technology than the addition of surface active agents to modify nanoparticle surfaces. While thermally-activated CVD simply works by initiating the monomers using heat, some other techniques are more powerful and versatile. Indeed, higher energy CVD methods open up possibilities to a wider range of monomers. Unfortunately, different terminologies and classifications due to parallel work have led to confusion. This paper presents and explains the different techniques as well as their equivalent terminologies to clarify the big picture. While the demand for functionalized nanoparticles grows rapidly, current functionalization methods are still too expensive for most applications. This paper is intended to be a practical review of the gas phase methods available in order to identify a potential candidate for large scale functionalization of nanoparticles. This study identifies photo-initiated CVD (PICVD) as an ideal solution for scalable particle functionalization technology. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The resulting CP-AgNW/cPI heater was mechanically stable with increases in resistance of {\textless}10{\%} under long-term cyclic bending to a curvature radius of 500 $\mu$m for up to 50,000 cycles. A roughness measurement revealed that the high flexibility originated from the electrodes being fully embedded at the surface of the polymer. The fabricated electrode was rapidly heated from room temperature to steady-state temperature within 40 s, with a peak temperature exceeding 200 °C. AgNW hybridization with CP layers was more efficient at lower NW densities, demonstrated by comparisons between the measured and calculated sheet resistance (Rs) of the electrodes. The addition of CP to the existing AgNW electrodes enhanced the steady-state temperature and current-carrying capacity of the fabricated heaters. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the proposed method of inverted layer-by-layer processing of AgNWs and CP is suitable to achieve a highly reliable and efficient transparent heater.},

	abstract = {Buckypaper is a thin sheet fabricated from the aggregation of carbon nanotubes. The generally accepted method for forming such carbon nanotube (CNT) films involves the use of stable suspension of carbon nanotubes in water. These suspensions can then be membrane-filtered under pressure to yield uniform films. After preparation of a stable solution, it should be membrane-filtrated on the surface of a filter. Usually, the quality of a buckypaper depends on sonication time and power, surfactant type and concentration, filter type, and concentration of carbon nanotube. In order to investigate the surface quality of buckypapers, low-magnification images could give rather useful information about the roughness of surface. Analysis of the 100 × images clearly shows that with increasing the suspension concentration, the smoothness of buckypaper surface will decrease. Therefore, from this viewpoint, decreasing the concentration can enhance the quality of the buckypaper. Surface of the filter also affects on the buckypaper quality. Therefore, for filtration of the suspension, a filter with suitable material, pore sizes, and surface should be used. As the pore sizes of the filter are usually small, the filtration process may be very time-consuming. Since the process is carring out under pressure and also due to the brittle nature of the buckypaper, removal of the buckypaper from the surface of the filter is a very serious and important stage and depends on the filter type, concentration, and type of CNTs. The buckypaper usually can be removed from the filter mechanically. The type of CNTs (MWNT or SWNT) may change the above-mentioned factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {The dielectric relaxation due to interfacial charges in metal particle-filled composites occurs in the optical (high frequency) regime. However, many applications would benefit from a shift of the relaxation to a much lower frequency regime (e.g. radio or microwave range). This could be achieved by using a filler with reduced conductivity, but there is no continuum of conductivity in naturally occurring materials to allow engineers to readily achieve this aim or to have complete design freedom. Recently, it was demonstrated, experimentally and theoretically, how insulating particles with nano-scale metal coatings enable this relaxation to be shifted to a lower frequency regime. The current work investigates the microstructure of the metal coating, highlighting a semi-continuous coating structure. Therefore, the relevance of a two-dimensional (2D) percolation -based model to describe the effective dielectric properties of the coating is explored. It is demonstrated that a model in which the metal coating is assumed to be near the 2D percolation threshold can provide a reasonable fit to the experimental data. An improved fit is achieved when a distribution of metal area coverage is permitted.},

	abstract = {Measuring quantitatively the nanoparticle dispersion of a composite material requires more than choosing a particular parameter and determining its correspondence to good and bad dispersion. It additionally requires anticipation of the measure's behaviour towards imperfect experimental data, such as that which can be obtained from a limited number of samples. It should be recognised that different samples from a common parent population can give statistically different responses due to sample variation alone and a measure of the likelihood of this occurring allows a decision on the dispersion to be made. It is also important to factor into the analysis the quality of the data in the micrograph with it: (a) being incomplete because some of the particles present in the micrograph are indistinguishable or go unseen; (b) including additional responses which are false. With the use of our preferred method, this article investigates the effects on the measured dispersion quality of nanoparticles of the micrograph's magnification settings, the role of the fraction of nanoparticles visible and the number of micrographs used. It is demonstrated that the best choice of magnification, which gives the clearest indication of dispersion type, is dependent on the type of nanoparticle structure present. Furthermore, it is found that the measured dispersion can be modified by particle loss, through the limitations of micrograph construction, and material/microscope imperfections such as cut marks and optical aberrations which could lead to the wrong conclusions being drawn. The article finishes by showing the versatility of the dispersion measure by characterising various different spatial features.},

	abstract = {High-performance poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) nanocomposites have been prepared via melt- blending by the incorporation of a hydroxylated polymer derivative (HPEEK) covalently grafted onto the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Their morphology, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties have been investigated and compared with the behaviour of composites reinforced with similar non-grafted fillers. Microscopic observations reveal that the grafting of the HPEEK onto the SWCNTs facilitates their dispersion within the matrix. The crystallization and melting temperature of PEEK decrease upon incorporation of the HPEEK-grafted SWCNTs, ascribed to the restrictions on polymer chain mobility imposed by the strong CNT–matrix interactions. The addition of these fillers leads to an exceptional increase in the thermal stability, storage modulus and glass transition temperature of the matrix. Tensile tests show unprecedented improvements in the Young's modulus, strength and toughness of the composites by the polymer grafting, attributed to a very effective load transfer achieved through covalent and hydrogen bonding. Electrical conductivity measurements indicate that the typical percolation behaviour takes place at very low SWCNT contents. In contrast, the thermal conductivity increases almost linearly with the filler loading. This approach is a simple, scalable and efficient method to improve the overall performance of thermoplastic nanocomposites for potential lightweight structural applications.},

This is discussed in terms of a simple two-parameter model for the critical strain energy release rate associated with crack propagation along the interface, which incorporates the rate of establishment of intimate contact at the interface. The model provides a self-consistent phenomenological description of the time and temperature dependence of the bonding kinetics in polyamide 12 joints, although questions remain regarding the detailed mechanisms of bonding.},

We processed both industrially-produced multi-wall CNT (MWCNT) powders and MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films made in-house, and demonstrate that while the raw CNTs are individualized and dispersed comparably within the polymer matrix, the electrical conductivity of the final nanocomposites differs significantly due to the intrinsic characteristics of the CNTs. Owing to their longer length after dispersion, the percolation threshold observed using MWCNTs from vertically-aligned films is five times lower than the value for industrially-produced MWCNT powders. Further, owing to the high structural quality of the CNTs from vertically-aligned films, the resulting composite films exhibit electrical conductivity of 10(3) S m(-1) at 2 wt{\%} CNTs. On the contrary, composites made using the industrially-produced CNTs exhibit conductivity of only tens of S m(-1). To our knowledge, the measured electrical conductivity for CNT/PS composites using CNTs from vertically-aligned films is by far the highest value yet reported for CNT/PS nanocomposites at this loading.},

	abstract = {As nanocomposite materials enter the marketplace, it is critical to consider the entire life cycle of those products, including end of life and reuse of scrap. While recycling of polymer based materials is widely accepted for manufacturing and consumer scrap, the influence of the nanoscale filler on the recycling process has received little attention and may pose some unique challenges, such as the potential for human exposure to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during the recycling process. In this work, the impact of recycling on CNT-filled polypropylene (PP) properties and exposures was studied by repeated injection molding and granulation up to twenty cycles, while simultaneously monitoring exposures. Characterization of chemical structure, melt rheology, mechanical properties, and morphology were performed on recycled materials. Both the neat and filled materials showed a reduction in viscosity with recycling, but the changes were greater for the neat materials. The mechanical properties (such as modulus, strength, toughness) were also affected by recycling. The Young's modulus, yield strain and stress for both neat PP and CNT-filled PP were found to be little affected by recycling. Strain and stress at break for neat PP decreased with recycling, but only slight changes were found for the CNT-filled PP. The CNT-filled PP showed an increase in toughness with recycling due to changes in the crystallization behaviour. This offers potential for addition of CNTs for the purpose of improving recycling resistance. However, recycling should be performed under proper exposure controls because grinding generated high exposures to nanoparticles and CNT-containing respirable fibers.},

In this article, two equations are proposed to determine, a and K, for chitosan in any solvent-temperature system using the previous reported viscometric constants data. This study resulted in two following equations:Exponent a = 0.6202 + 0.699 x / (0.4806 + x)log K {\textperiodcentered} 10- 5= - 5.7676 {\textperiodcentered} Exponent a + 5.9232where x equals to [DA/pH{\textperiodcentered}$\mu$], with DA, degree of acetylation of chitosan, pH of chitosan solution in a solvent with ionic strength of $\mu$. The two equations are used to determine the constants of chitosan solution without urea between 20 and 30 °C. The validity of prediction of the constants from the knowledge of the DA, pH and ionic strength were examined using the above equations. The constants were obtained by a deviation in the range of ±0.40-29.0{\%} for the exponent a, and ±6-71{\%} for most of K values. The deviation of experimental and calculation data is reasonable. This is because several factors affecting the correct values for the constants were not taken into consideration by authors whose reported experimental data. The effects of temperature and urea on the constants have been described and taken into consideration in this article. The author of this manuscript described the various parameters affecting the constants. The procedures to determine the correct values of the constants for chitosan were also explained. The author of this study introduced the empirical function for chitin/chitosan chain conformation, (DA/$\mu${\textperiodcentered}pH), as a measure of chain stiffness in solution. The empirical value or hydrodynamic volume of the polyelectrolyte molecule in solution increased with an increase in DA and a decrease in $\mu$ of solvent and pH of solution. The quality of different solvents was compared using the latter empirical parameter. Different solvents, which were used to determine the intrinsic viscosities and the viscometric constants, a and K (published in the literature for chitosan), were compared. The latter empirical parameter was also compared with B-parameter defined by Smidsr{\o}rd {\&} Haug as chain stiffness; d ln [$\eta$]/d(1/T), and d ln [$\eta$]/dT as chain flexibility of the polymer. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The additional matrix was inserted at the interface in the form of films of various thicknesses. Three different manufacturing techniques, namely autoclave consolidation, press consolidation and stamp forming, were used to prepare different sets of specimens with varying resin-rich bond line thickness. The occurrence of fibre migration towards the matrix rich interface was induced by the manufacturing techniques used due to their different processing times.

	abstract = {Induction welding for thermoplastic composite materials uses an alternating current flowing through a coil to induce an electromagnetic field and generate eddy current inside laminate with various fiber orientations – the generated heat causes the laminate to heat up and melt the polymer. As a pressure is applied to the induction heating zones, cohesive bonding may occur during the melting of the polymer. The welding quality of the composite materials is highly influenced by the temperature varying inside the heating zones. Thus, it is beneficial for induction welding if temperature varying during heating can be acquired given a set of welding parameters, such as current, pressure, fiber orientations, etc. Conducting practical induction heating experiments for this purpose is laborious and time consuming given the large varying space of welding parameters. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using machine learning techniques to model the relation between the welding parameters and the temperature varying inside the heating zones. We conduct two sets of induction heating experiments for laminate welding and the collected sample temperature varying data are used to train the neural networks with input of welding parameters and output of the predicted temperature varying. Testing of the models demonstrates that process modeling of induction welding with machine learning techniques is viable.},

The numerical analysis was also extended to investigate the effects of the aspect ratio, the electrical conductivity, the aggregation and the shape of CNTs on the electrical properties of the nanocomposites. A simple empirical model was also established based on present numerical simulations to predict the electrical conductivity in several electronic composites with various fillers.

The article starts with a concise and general background about VGCNF production, applications, structure, dimension, and electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. Next composites of VGCNF/polymer are discussed. Composite electrical, EMI SE and thermal properties are elaborated in terms of nanofibers dispersion, distribution and aspect ratio. Special emphasis is paid to dispersion of nanofibers by melt mixing. Influence of other processing methods such as in-situ polymerization, spinning, and solution processing on final properties of VGCNF/polymer composite is also reviewed. We present properties of CNTs and CFs, which are competitive fillers to VGCNFs, and the most significant properties of their composites compared to those of VGCNF/polymer composites. At the conclusion of the article, we summarize the most significant achievements and address the future challenges and tasks in the area related to characterizing VGCNF aspect ratio and dispersion, determining the influence of processing methods and conditions on VGCNF/polymer composites and understanding the structure/property relationship in VGCNF/polymer composites. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Electric heating performance of CGE was investigated at different heat flux densities, wind speed and ambient temperature. A uniform temperature distributed was observed on the surface of CGE detected by an infrared temperature camera. The electric heating performance was verified by deicing a certain amount of ice at different heat flux densities under two kinds of ambient conditions: -22 C without wind and -22 C with 14 m/s of the wind speed. The deicing time under the two conditions were less than 220 and 450 s, respectively. The feasibility of the deicing performance was demonstrated through a series of experiments and the results indicate this material is a promising candidate as an electric heating material for deicing. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Cyclohexanol and xylene were used as carbon precursors, for synthesis of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) arrays in a CVD system at temperature of 750 ??C, using nitrogen as carrier gas and ferrocene as catalyst. Different characterization methods were employed to compare the MWCNTs structure synthesized by these two precursors. All scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman spectroscopy results illustrated that using cyclohexanol could significantly reduce formation of amorphous carbon and catalyst particles in the as-grown CNTs. The less amorphous carbon can be attributed to in situ oxidation in presence of oxygen atom of cyclohexanol. Characterizations showed that MWCNTs with high purity could be obtained using cyclohexanol as carbon precursor. The as-grown MWCNTs were purified by oxidation and acid treatment. Characterization of the purified MWCNTs using HNO 3/H 2SO 4 (1/3 or 1/1), 8 M HCl or 8 M HNO 3 was carried out. The results showed that 8 M HNO 3 could be considered as the best chemical to obtain more pure MWCNTs, less amorphous and metal particles and less damaged MWCNTs. The Raman spectroscopy results demonstrated that HNO 3/H 2SO 4 (1/3) treatment could more disorder the MWCNTs structure and this was attributed to the bigger destroying effect of this acid treatment. Furthermore, the TEM analysis of MWCNTs before and after acid treatment revealed that acid treatment could remove encapsulated catalyst particles. The FTIR analysis illustrated that purification of the MWCNTs with nitric acid could connect the functional groups onto the outer surface of MWCNTs and this resulted in more dispersion of the MWCNTs in water. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this chapter, we briefly summarize the intrinsic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), a special class of CNTs, and their corresponding applications in these fields. SWNTs have been utilized for the ultrasensitive detection of biological species, providing a label-free approach. SWNT-Raman tags have achieved detection sensitivity down to 1 fmol/L. SWNT-based drug delivery systems have shown promising potential based on preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies. Also, the remarkable optical properties of SWNTs have made them promising candidates as contrast agents for imaging in cells and animals. Moreover, due to their excellent mechanical strength, SWNTs have been used to improve the mechanical properties of solid polymeric nanocomposites and porous scaffolds. Sample preparation procedures for the use of SWNTs as fluorescent imaging labels and in biological composites will be discussed.},

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy and N2-adsorption analysis were carried out to characterize the composite catalysts. In using the sol-gel method, the MWCNTs were coated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, and by the hydrothermal method, rutile TiO2 nanorods were uniformly deposited on the MWCNTs. The photocatalytic activities of the composite catalysts were evaluated by the reduction of CO2 with H2O. The results indicate that the addition of an appropriate amount of MWCNTs as supports for TiO2 could remarkably improve the efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction. The composite catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method lead to the main formation of C2H5OH, while HCOOH is found to be the major product on the sample prepared by the hydrothermal method. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes (P-MWCNTs) were functionalized with carboxylic groups (MWCNT-COOH) through oxidation reactions and then reduced to produce hydroxyl groups (MWCNT-OH). Pristine and functionalized MWCNTs were used to produce poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) nanocomposites with 0.5 wt{\%} of MWCNTs. MWCNT functionalization was verified by visual stability in water, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and zeta potential measurements. Pristine and functionalized MWCNTs acted as the nucleating agent in a PHBV matrix, as verified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). However, the dispersion of filler into the matrix, thermal stability, and direct current (DC) conductivity were affected by MWCNT functionalization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that filler dispersion into the PHBV matrix was improved with MWCNT functionalization. The surface roughness was reduced with the addition and functionalization of MWCNT. The thermal stability of PHBV/MWCNT-COOH, PHBV/P-MWCNT, and PHBV/MWCNT-OH nanocomposites were 20, 30, and 30 °C higher than neat PHBV, respectively, as verified by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). Addition of pristine and functionalized MWCNTs provided electrical conductivity in nanocomposite, which was higher for PHBV/P-MWCNTs (1.2 × 10-5 S cm-1).},

The statistical distribution of the resistance of the heating elements was characterised, and the effects of the temperature on the heating element resistance were evaluated. The influence of the mechanical contact pressure on the contact resistance was also investigated. One of the main process parameters in resistance welding, i.e. the power density, was studied in detail. Heating uniformity in the heating elements was assessed through thermal imaging, allowing for a comparison between fabric and unidirectional heating elements. Temperature histories were measured and compared to those simulated by a three-dimensional transient heat transfer finite-element model. Factors limiting the size of the welded joint, i.e. temperature non-uniformity within the welding area and current leaking to the laminate, were investigated. Proper electrical insulation using a glass-fibre/PEI interlayer between the heating element and the laminate when joining carbon-fibre/PEI laminates effectively eliminated current leaking and enabled large-scale resistance welding.},

The laminate surfaces chemical composition was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Subsequently, the laminates were fusion bonded through an autoclave cycle. The mechanical performance of the joints was characterized by mode-I fracture toughness and short beam strength tests. The surface of some of the composite laminates were found to contain high concentration of the release medium residues after consolidation. This contamination showed a significant effect on the mechanical performance of fusion bonded joints.

The time required to achieve intimate contact predicted by a three-dimensional transient finite-element model featuring heat transfer and consolidation correlated well with the optimal welding time. The influence of the welding pressure on lap shear strength was investigated, and the consolidation quality obtained in the welded joint was related to the processing conditions. The extent of flow occurring during welding, or the reduction of thickness of the welded joints, was shown to be related to lap shear strength. Four failure mechanisms, leading to different values of lap shear strength, were identi{\textregistered}ed including interfacial failure, cohesive failure of the heating element, tearing of the heating element and tearing of the laminate. Experimental and numerical processing windows were constructed and correlated well to each other. A comparison between fabric and unidirectional heating elements, in terms of lap shear strength and the interlaminar fracture toughness, GIc, was performed. It was demonstrated that large-scale lap-shear coupons and double cantilever beam specimens can be resistance welded providing that current leaking to the laminate is avoided.},

One of the important processing steps--intimate contact development-is considered in this paper. Interlaminar inti- mate contact development has a strong dependency on the thermoplastic surface geometry. Profilometric measurements of common thermoplastic prepreg tows, such asAS4/PEEKand IM7/PKA, show that surface roughness features appear at several length scales and that the surfaces have fractal asperity structures. In this paper, principles of fractal geometry are used to describe prepreg surfaces. Based on this description, a microscale fluid flow model is developed to relate a degree of intimate contact to the process parameters (pressure, temperature, and time) and the fractal parameters of the surface. The model development and comparisons with experimental data are presented and discussed.},

The versatility of CVD had led to rapid growth and it has become one of the main processing methods for the deposition of thin films and coatings for a wide range of applications, including semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge, Si 1-xGe x, III-V, II-VI) for microelectronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion devices; dielectrics (e.g. SiO 2, AlN, Si 3N 4) for microelectronics; refractory ceramic materials (e.g. SiC, TiN, TiB 2, Al 2O 3, BN, MoSi 2, ZrO 2) used for hard coatings, protection against corrosion, oxidation or as diffusion barriers; metallic films (e.g. W, Mo, Al, Au, Cu, Pt) for microelectronics and for protective coatings; fibre production (e.g. B and SiC monofilament fibres) and fibre coating. This contribution aims to provide a brief overview of CVD of films and coatings. The fundamental aspects of CVD including process principle, deposition mechanism, reaction chemistry, thermodynamics, kinetics and transport phenomena will be presented. In addition, the practical aspects of CVD such as the CVD system and apparatus used, CVD process parameters, process control techniques, range of films synthesized, characterisation and co-relationships of structures and properties will be presented. The advantages and limitations of CVD will be discussed, and its applications will be briefly reviewed. The article will also review the development of CVD technologies based on different heating methods, and the type of precursor used which has led to different variants of CVD methods including thermally activated CVD, plasma enhanced CVD, photo-assisted CVD, atomic layer epitaxy process, metalorganic assisted CVD. There are also variants such as fluidised-bed CVD developed for coating powders; electrochemical vapour deposition for depositing dense films onto porous substrates; chemical vapour infiltration for the fabrication of C-C composites and CMCs through the deposition and densification of ceramic layers onto porous fibre preforms. The emerging cost-effective CVD-based techniques such as electrostatic-aerosol assisted CVD and flame assisted CVD will be highlighted. The scientific and technological significance of these different variants of CVD will be discussed and compared with other vapour processing techniques such as Physical Vapour Deposition. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes have long been recognized as the stiffest and strongest man-made material known to date. In addition, their high electrical conductivity has roused interest in the area of electrical appliances and communication related applications. However, due to their miniscule size, the excellent properties of these nanostructures can only be exploited if they are homogeneously embedded into light-weight matrices as those offered by a whole series of engineering polymers. We review the present state of polymer nanocomposites research in which the fillers are carbon nanotubes. In order to enhance their chemical affinity to engineering polymer matrices, chemical modification of the graphitic sidewalls and tips is necessary. In this review, an extended account of the various chemical strategies for grafting polymers onto carbon nanotubes and the manufacturing of carbon nanotube/polymer nanocomposites is given. The mechanical and electrical properties to date of a whole range of nanocomposites of various carbon nanotube contents are also reviewed in an attempt to facilitate progress in this emerging area. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The s-CNT/PE composite exhibits superior electrical conductivity up to 2 orders of magnitude over that of p-CNT/PE and r-CNT/PE composites, at the same CNT loading. Only 5 wt{\%} CNT addition in the s-CNT/PE composite realizes an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) as high as 46.4 dB, which is 20{\%} and 46{\%} higher than that for p-CNT/PE and r-CNT/PE composites, respectively. The selectively distributed CNTs at the interfaces between PE polyhedrons would certainly increase the effective CNT concentrations that form conducting pathways and thus increase the electrical conductivity and EMI SE in the s-CNT/PE composites. Such special structure also provides numerous interfaces that absorb the electromagnetic waves, resulting in an absorption-dominated shielding mechanism. Our work suggests that designing conductive networks in polymer composites is a promising approach to develop high-performance EMI shielding materials.},

	abstract = {Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK)/multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT) composites containing up to 17 wt{\%} filler were prepared using a twin screw extruder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that the MWNTs were homogeneously dispersed in the PEEK matrix. Linear viscoelastic measurements show that both complex viscosity and moduli increase with increasing MWNT concentration. The storage modulus, G′ exhibits a dramatic seven order increase in magnitude around 1 wt{\%}, leading to a solid-like low-frequency behaviour at higher loadings; the effect can be attributed to network formation at a rheological percolation threshold. Rheotens measurements show that the melt strength also increases significantly on addition of nanotubes, however, the drawability decreases. An analytical Wagner model was used to calculate the apparent elongational viscosity over a wide range of elongational rates, and to reveal significant increases on addition of MWNTs, with a similar threshold behaviour. The electrical response is also dominated by percolation effects, increasing by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 10-11 to 10-1 S/cm, on the addition of only 2 wt{\%} MWNTs. In contrast, the thermal conductivity and tensile elastic modulus of the composites increased linearly with nanotube content, rising by 130{\%} and 50{\%}, at 17 wt{\%} MWNTs, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Conducting polymers are obtained by monomer oxidation using various strategies such as the chemical oxidative polymerization in solution, the electrochemical polymerization on conductive substrates or the vapor-phase polymerization, leading to have an easy control of the surface morphology at micro- or a nanoscale with a surface wettability going from superhydrophilicity to superoleophobicity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic viscosity measurements used to calculate the Mark-Houwink (M-H) parameters are generally performed for different molecular weights at a constant temperature, with the standard value of this temperature being 25°C, or else 37°C in the case of mammalian proteins, or else under theta conditions for polymers and biopolymers. In the polymer industry, polysaccharides and proteins must circulate through pipes during transport processes where pumps have a very high-energy expenditure and where temperatures must be greatly increased, and at this point calculation of the Mark-Houwink parameters becomes important. The M-H parameters are calculated at standardized temperatures and in many cases, these are not useful because of the errors they carry, and it then becomes very difficult to calculate the molecular weight. It is therefore necessary to know the change in molecular weight as evidence of a change in the product obtained, as this may create a need to halt the production process, transport, or extrusion. The basic criterion is that the molecular weight does not change with temperature, or at least within one discrete range of temperatures, but that there is hydrodynamic change (intrinsic viscosity). The method is simple and requires iterative mathematical processing and measurement of intrinsic viscosity at different temperatures.},

	abstract = {The approach for joining thermosetting matrix composites (TSCs) proposed in this study is based on the use of a low melting co-cured thermoplastic film, added as a last ply in the stacking sequence of the composite laminate. During curing, the thermoplastic film partially penetrates in the first layer of the thermosetting composite, leading to macro-mechanical interlocking as the main connection mechanism between the thermoplastic film and the underlying composite. After curing, the thermosetting composite joints with the thermoplastic modified surface can be assembled by welding. Welding of the TSC-TSC joints is performed by ultrasonic and induction welding. The weld strength is investigated by morphological characterization of cross sections and failure surfaces and by mechanical testing. The effect of the thermoplastic film thickness on the welding process and on its outcome is also analyzed. Both induction and ultrasonic welding mostly result in good-quality welded joints. The welding process used as well as the initial thickness of the thermoplastic film are found to have a significant effect on the final thickness of the weld line and on the location of failure. Thicker thermoplastic films are found to ease the welding processes.},

There is also insufficiently defined correlation between the microstructure and the physical properties of the composite. Here, we offer a review of the dispersion processes of pristine (non-covalently functionalized) CNTs in a solvent or a polymer solution. We summarize and adapt relevant theoretical analysis to guide the dispersion design and selection, from the processes of mixing/sonication, to the application of surfactants for stabilization, to the final testing of composite properties.

However, their most promising appli- cations require the isolation of individualized, purified nanotubes, often with specific optoelectronic characteristics. A wide range of dispersion and separation techniques have been developed, but the use of sonication or ultracentrifugation imposes severe limits on scalability and may introduce damage. Here, we demonstrate a new, intrinsically scalable method for SWNT dispersion and separation, using reductive treatment in sodium metal-ammonia solutions, optionally followed by selective dissolution in a polar aprotic organic solvent. In situ small-angle neutron scattering demonstrates the presence of dissolved, unbundled SWNTs in solution, at concentrations reaching at least 2 mg/mL; the ability to isolate individual nanotubes is confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Spectroscopy data suggest that the soluble fraction contains predominately large metallic nanotubes; a potential new mechanism for nanotube separation is proposed. In addition, the G/D ratios observed during the dissolution sequence, as a function of metal: carbon ratio, demonstrate a new purification method for removing carbonaceous impurities from pristine SWNTs, which avoids traditional, damaging, competitive oxidation reactions.},

In particular, we studied the influence of silver nanoparticles aspect ratio on these thermal properties. We compared nanospheres with nanowires. A low electrical percolation threshold (0.55 vol{\%}) is obtained for silver nanowires composites compared to spherical particles (10.8 vol{\%}). Thermal conductivity increases with silver content and the influence of filler aspect ratio is interesting: thanks to nanowires, the thermal conductivity enhancement is reached for lower silver content. Experimental data are well fitted with Nan model. Specific heat capacity decreases with the introduction of silver nanoparticles, following the mixture rule independently of aspect ratio. Composites thermal diffusivity also increases with increasing silver content and influence of filler aspect ratio can be brought to light. Temperature dependence of these thermal properties indicate a dominant heat transport mechanism typical of disordered materials},

The models are validated by experimental data from open literature. An optimization process is carried out to identify the microstructural configuration of the composite that provides the highest improvement in terms of electrical conductivity for the lowest structural weight in a CFRP fuselage design. The through-the-thickness conductivity of the composite laminate is considerably enhanced by a 2{\%} volume fraction dispersion of CNTs within the matrix resin. The increase in the dielectric properties is accompanied by a moderate improvement of the composite mechanical performance. The hybrid CFRP/CNT composite configuration leads to a weight-efficient design solution for representative fuselage structures.},

The mechanisms of void formation in adherends, in particular, the residual volatile-induced voids and the fibre de-compaction-induced voids, were analysed. Due to the non-uniform temperature and stress distributions in the joints during welding, a non-uniform void distribution was observed in the joints with more voids generated in the middle of the joints than at the edges. Welding temperature and pressure were shown to have a large influence on void formation. Increasing of welding pressure was shown to effectively reduce the voids, while the residual moisture-induced voids were found more difficult to be eliminated than the fibre de-compaction-induced voids.},

Shorter tracer chains exhibit a greater slowing down than longer chains, whereas longer matrix chains decrease the value of $\phi$crit. The experimental results are discussed in terms of locally anisotropic diffusion perpendicular andparallel to the nanotube filler andsimulated using a trap model that defines a trap size and the extent of slowing perpendicular to the cylindrical trap. The simulated diffusion coefficients capture both the initial decrease in D attributed to isolated traps and the recovery of D above $\phi$crit corresponding to trap percolation.

In this work, the welding-based joining technology, friction spot joining, was selected to study the failure and fracture micro-mechanisms of an aluminum-composite single lap joint. Failure analysis suggested that the radial cracks nucleate at the periphery of the bonding area and propagate rapidly until failure of the so-called adhesion zone. Upon further loading the cracks propagate into the transition and plastically deformed zones leading to a reduction of the stiffness of the joint. The findings of the fractography demonstrated a mixed brittle-ductile fracture. Three zones were identified on the fracture surfaces: a smooth and featureless area demonstrating brittle fracture, a quasi-smooth area representing a mixture of ductile and brittle fractures and finally a zone with a highly rough surface implying ductile fracture of the composite part. Further, fiber pull-out and breakage were identified as additional fracture micro-mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In the presented investigation, the ultra- sonic metal welding technique was applied successfully to join sheet metals with CFRP. The welding times were always less than 4 s. By using the CCC-model it was possible to find the optimal welding parameters with only 15{\%} of the necessary tests in comparison to a stepwise investigation of the relevant welding parameters. SEM micrographs of the bonding zone show that an intensive connection between the metallic material and the load bearing carbon fibres of the CFRP has developed during the ultrasonic welding process. The polymer matrix was displaced out of the welding zone. Finally, no damage of the carbon fibre reinforcement was observed. The possibility to join different sheet metals to CFRP with high-strength extends the application fields for the ultrasonic metal welding technique. Regarding the efficiency, automation, ecological compatibility and the achievable mechanical and technological properties, ultrasonic metal welding is an attractive alternative to existing polymer joining techniques. Application fields for ultrasonic welded hybrid joints can be seen in the automotive industry, e.g. to join different lightweight structures by using fibre reinforced materials or in the aircraft industry for construction elements of the fuselage, the aerofoil or the tail fin. {\textcopyright} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

	abstract = {R{\'{E}}SUM{\'{E}} Parmi les objectifs de performance {\`{a}} atteindre lors de la conception d'un nouvel a{\'{e}}ronef, la r{\'{e}}duction de la masse de l'appareil est au premier rang, ladite masse ayant une influence directe sur les co{\^{u}}ts variables de l'op{\'{e}}ration de l'a{\'{e}}ronef. {\`{A}} cette fin, l'industrie a graduellement introduit les mat{\'{e}}riaux composites dans les composantes structurelles, desquelles le fuselage est peut-{\^{e}}tre la plus importante. La conversion du fuselage de l'aluminium aux mat{\'{e}}riaux composites n'est pas sans g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rer son lot de probl{\`{e}}mes satellites. Notamment, la diminution de la conductivit{\'{e}} {\'{e}}lectrique de la surface de l'appareil rend celui-ci vuln{\'{e}}rable aux effets n{\'{e}}fastes de la foudre. En r{\'{e}}action {\`{a}} cette vuln{\'{e}}rabilit{\'{e}}, des grillages m{\'{e}}talliques continus ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} ajout{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} la surface externe des panneaux composant le fuselage. Cet ajout augmentant consid{\'{e}}rablement la masse de l'ensemble sans contribuer {\`{a}} la rigidit{\'{e}}, une demande pour des solutions alternatives fut cr{\'{e}}{\'{e}}e. L'ajout graduel de charges conductrices {\`{a}} une matrice isolante donne lieu {\`{a}} une augmentation subite de la conductivit{\'{e}} du composite et {\`{a}} une transition de l'{\'{e}}tat isolant {\`{a}} celui de conducteur {\`{a}} une concentration donn{\'{e}}e, appel{\'{e}}e le seuil de percolation. La recherche sur les composites de nanotubes de carbone a permis de mettre en {\'{e}}vidence un seuil de percolation extr{\^{e}}mement bas pour les particules de haut rapport d'aspect. En r{\'{e}}action, de multiples {\'{e}}tudes se sont succ{\'{e}}d{\'{e}} qui cherch{\`{e}}rent {\`{a}} repousser les limites de la conductivit{\'{e}} {\'{e}}lectrique de tels mat{\'{e}}riaux. Malheureusement, leur performance est limit{\'{e}}e par une importante r{\'{e}}sistance de contact {\`{a}} l'interface entre les particules au sein du composite. Pour qu'un composite ait une conductivit{\'{e}} {\'{e}}lectrique assez {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}}e pour canaliser l'{\'{e}}nergie de la foudre, les charges utilis{\'{e}}es devront {\^{e}}tre caract{\'{e}}ris{\'{e}}es simultan{\'{e}}ment par une faible r{\'{e}}sistance de contact, par une haute conductivit{\'{e}} intrins{\`{e}}que et par une propension {\`{a}} former un r{\'{e}}seau connect{\'{e}} dans la matrice. Une strat{\'{e}}gie r{\'{e}}pondant {\`{a}} ces exigences consiste {\`{a}} forcer la percolation d'un r{\'{e}}seau de charges m{\'{e}}talliques par leur auto-organisation dans le composite. Dans cette optique, nous avons explor{\'{e}} la combinaison d'une dispersion aqueuse de collo{\"{i}}des d'{\'{e}}poxy et d'un pr{\'{e}}curseur liquide de l'argent, aussi {\`{a}} base aqueuse. ABSTRACT Among all performance targets a new aircraft design seeks to achieve, reduction in weight is of primary importance since it has a direct influence on the energy costs. In pursuing this target, an increasing proportion of composite materials has been introduced into modern aircrafts' structures. Perhaps the most important structural component, the fuselage has not been spared by change. Every change requires adjustment, and thus the problem of lightning strikes to aircraft has resurfaced as the conductive aluminum skin was replaced by a lower conductivity carbon fiber/polymer composite counterpart. Bonding a continuous metallic mesh to the surface of the skin has solved the problem, only to see the quest for mass minimization resume as this additional metal along with its adhesive and matrix contributes to the weight without benefits on the structural front. A better technology is sought. Upon gradually incorporating conductive fillers in a non-conductive matrix, the material undergoes a sudden change from an insulator to a conductor at a concentration called the percolation threshold which differs for every matrix-filler combination and filler dispersion state. Research on carbon nanotubes composites has highlighted the ability of high aspect ratio fillers to reach percolation at a very low concentration. However, issues with contact resistance between individual particles inhibit the maximum performance such composites can historically reach. If a polymer composite is to fulfill the requirements of lightning strike protection, the filler used should display simultaneously a high conductivity, a low contact resistance and a propensity to form connected networks through the matrix. One strategy to obtain such a combination of properties is to force the percolation of metallic fillers through self-organization upon forming the composite. We explored such an avenue by combining an aqueous colloidal epoxy dispersion with a water-based silver precursor ink. Upon solvent evaporation, elemental silver precipitates preferentially in the continuous aqueous phase, effectively segregating the conductive phase in a connected topology and thus promoting the conductivity of the composite. A very low percolation threshold was achieved, at only 0.27 vol.{\%}, whereas typical silver fillers percolation occurs around 20 vol. {\%}.},

	abstract = {We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance methods applied over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC (relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of $\mu$0 = 18.50 ± 0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values (in km s-1 Mpc-1) of H0 = 71 ± 2 ± 6 (systematic) (Type Ia supernovae), H0 = 71 ± 3 ± 7 (Tully-Fisher relation), H0 = 70 ± 5 ± 6 (surface brightness fluctuations), H0 = 72 ± 9 ± 7 (Type II supernovae), and H0 = 82 ± 6 ± 9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results for the different methods with three different weighting schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H0 = 72 ± 8 km s-1 Mpc-1. Finally, we compare these results with other, global methods for measuring H0.},

@article{Holden1969,
	abstract = {An important new class of polymers, the thermoplastic elastomers, was announced by the Shell Chemical Company (U.S.A.) in 1965. These new products may be formed into useful articles by modern rapid thermoplastics processing techniques, such as injection molding, and without any chemical vulcanization step provide most of the useful physical properties of vulcanized rubber. High resilience, high tensile strength, highly reversible elongation, and abrasion resistance are obtained. The thermoplastic elastomers consist of ordered, block copolymers of the general structure A‐B‐A, where A is a thermoplastic block polymer and B is an elastomeric block polymer. Choice of monomers, block length, and the weight fractions of A and B are crucial in achieving elastomeric performance. An example is the polystyrene–polybutadiene–polystyrene block copolymer (S‐B‐S) where the molecular weights of S and B and the weight fraction of S are restricted. A two‐phase system is formed, with the middle‐block phase constituting a continuous three‐dimensional elastomeric network and the dispersed end‐block phase serving as multijunction points for the ends of the middle blocks. These systems, without vulcanization, have rubber‐like properties similar to those of conventional rubber vulcanizates but flow as thermoplastics at temperatures above the glass transition of the end block. The behavior is fully temperature reversible. Melt viscosity behavior, measured as a function of shear and temperature, is similar to that of conventional thermoplastics. Activation energies obtained at constant shear stress vary with temperature: at high temperatures they are between those of the pure homopolymers and at low temperatures they approach that of the thermoplastic part of the molecule. Melt viscosities, however, are very much higher than those of either homopolymer of the same total molecular weight. An additional energy term is indicated in the flow process which arises from the transfer of the end block from one aggregate to another, in the process being forced to pass through the elastomeric matrix with which it is thermodynamically incompatible. The classical kinetic theory of rubber elasticity can be applied to these polymers, treating the end‐block phase as hard discrete particles which do not contribute to the elastic network For example, equilibrium modulus or swelling measurements are used to calculate the concentration of elastically effective chains or effective crosslink density. The resulting effective elastic chain length (Mc) is thus identified, not with the middle‐block segment length, but with the normal entanglement length. Hence, normal entanglement junctions in the elastomeric matrix behave as strong effective crosslinks because the ends of the middle block are securely anchored in the end‐block aggregates. High tensile strengths, in the absence of reinforcing fillers or crystallization, may be attributed to a highly perfected network (Case theory) or to the inertial masses of the discrete end‐block aggregates (Bueche theory), or to both. The physical properties of the thermoplastic elastomers over a range of temperatures are discussed.},

@article{Mantell1992a,
	abstract = {Models were developed which simulate the processing of thermoplastic matrix composites. The models relate the applied temperature, pressure, speed, and time to the temperature, crystallinity, consolidation, interlaminar bonding, and residual stresses and strains inside the composite. The formulations follow the models proposed by Springer, Loos, and their coworkers for manufacturing plates in a press or in an autoclave, but were extended to include cylindrical geometries, variations in the applied temperatures and pressures with position and time, and rapid bonding. These extensions make the models applicable to the manufacture of plates by tape laying and to filament winding of cylinders. These models were incorporated into a user friendly computer code which can be used to generate numerical results and to select the appropriate processing conditions for processing thermoplastic composite plates 1) in an autoclave, 2) in a press, or 3) by tape laying, and 4) for filament winding thermoplastic composite cylinders. {\textcopyright} 1992, Sage Publications.

@article{Yousefpour2004a,
	abstract = {Joining of thermoplastic composites is an important step in the manufacturing of aerospace thermoplastic composite structures. Therefore, several joining methods for thermoplastic composite components have been under investigation and development. In general, joining of thermoplastic composites can be categorized into mechanical fastening, adhesive bonding, solvent bonding, co-consolidation, and fusion bonding or welding. Fusion bonding or welding has great potential for the joining, assembly, and repair of thermoplastic composite components and also offers many advantages over other joining techniques. The process of fusion-bonding involves heating and melting the polymer on the bond surfaces of the components and then pressing these surfaces together for polymer solidification and consolidation. The focus of this paper is to review the different fusion-bonding methods for thermoplastic composite components and present recent developments in this area. The various welding techniques and the corresponding manufacturing methodologies, the required equipment, the effects of processing parameters on weld performance and quality, the advantages/disadvantages of each technique, and the applications are described.},
